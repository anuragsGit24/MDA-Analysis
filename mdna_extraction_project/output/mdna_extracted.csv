INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
PHARMA & CHEMICALS
Indian Pharmaceutical Industry: An overview
Current Market Trends and Scope
The Indian pharma industry has been growing at a Compounded Annual Growth rate (CAGR) of more than 15% over the
last five years and has significant growth opportunities. The growth driven factors in the domestic market are high burden
of disease, good economic growth leading to higher disposable incomes, improvements in healthcare infrastructure and
improved healthcare financing, the report of PwC – CII titled “India Pharma Inc.: Gearing up for the next level of growth”.
THE ROAD AHEAD: INDIAN PHARMA
Spending on healthcare is expected to increase in India at 9-12 per cent CAGR between 2018-22 to US$ 26-30 billion,
driven by increasing consumer spending, rapid urbanization, and raising healthcare insurance among others. Speedy
introduction of generic drugs into the market has remained in focus and is expected to benefit the Indian pharmaceutical
companies.
BUILDING BLOCKS OF ALCHEMIST LIMITED’S PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS:
As we said that “A Journey of Thousand Miles begins with a Single Step”, we have certainly taken many steps toward and
envision participating and completing the Clean India theme of Government of India with Healthy India.
Marketing Strategy: A Strategy has been put forward to serve the bottom of the pyramid…the masses. The Marketing
strategy of Alchemist is aimed at striking at the Mass of society while corporate strategies aim at striking the class,
Alchemist has ventured to address the healthcare problems of the mass of society. All the programs like “Quit India” are
aimed at creating awareness and solutions to the widespread diseases in society like Anemia, Calcium Deficiency and
Weak Immunity .The programs are mass based and societal in approach. Hence, Alchemist Marketing Strategy is based
on impacting the masses of India.
Geography and Customer Class: Pharmaceutical division of Alchemist Limited has presence in Metro/Class I/II and
Select class III towns across India. We are continuously striving for healthcare needs at the bottom of pyramid.
People:We consider our people as the most valuable assets of our business and they continue to define the Alchemist
Pharmaceutical division. We have a strong team of 250 people. Out of this, 180 are deployed in customer facing activities
and rests are engaged in plant and administrative functions.
Product Portfolio: We have carved a niche of innovative products which virtually stand out in the competition and occupy
mind space of medical fraternity. Our product portfolio is considered to be one of the best in the industry and it includes
therapy areas like Immune enhancer, Nutraceutical, Antibacterial, Gastrointestinal, Pain reliever, Anti-allergic, Anti-cold,
Steroids, Enzymes, Supplements, CNS etc.
We have almost PAN India presence and the current product portfolio of 400 SKUs in Ethical and Generics is the
back bone of our business which reaches to the deepest corners of the country.
Pharma division broad outlook: The Alchemist Pharma wing is known for its brands and possible outcomes in the most
dreaded diseases like Dengue, Chikungunya, Cancer, AIDS, Hepatitis, Acid Peptic Disorders, and Gastric Ulcers etc. we
believe we exist for society and hence we continue to serve our society through social programmes like Quit India to

is free of Anemia, Calcium Deficiency and Weak Immunity. Alchemist supports 50% free therapy to all poor patients. The
division has been able to create a strong space in the minds of doctors through niche brands.
Quit Anemia, Quit Calcium Deficiency and Quit Weak Immunity: Alchemist Pharma Initiative
After Independence, India has traversed many miles of success in diverse fields but healthcare continues to be a struggling
point for Independent India and is a stigma on one of the fastest growing economies of world. Government measures have
been done but have not been able to reach the masses. The only healthcare camp established by the Govt. of India
was”PULSE POLIO”which took almost 4 decades to make India a polio free country. As a result of the absence of such
measures, India and Indian Population continues to suffer from iron deficiency, calcium deficiency and weaken immunity.
Moreover, weak immune system leads to Swine flu, Dengue, RTI, Cough and Cold that are taking its toll on Indian masses.
Alchemist as a socially responsible corporate has decided to work till we make India free of these three cardinal elements
afflicting Indian Society.Alchemist too believes that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step and initiated its
most popular programme Quit India movement for ANEMIA, CALCIUM DEFICIENCY and WEAK IMMUNITY through a
nationwide campaign from July which will continue till we give India freedom from these ailments. This nationwide programme
is of importance as Alchemist has pledged to support 50% therapy free of cost to selectively poor patients on first purchase
and this medicine will directly go to the doctors from where it will be distributed to patients.
Alchemist is represented through brands Anemi-XT for Iron Deficiency, Valcal-M for Calcium Deficiency and IGTG FORTE
for Weak Immunity. The scope of this campaign is huge as alone Govt. efforts will not be sufficient to see that India is free
of these diseases. This campaign would endeavour Alchemist to achieve the wider aim in addition to Clean India campaign
of Govt. of India by making Healthy India. So its objectives are not only Clean India but ensuring a Healthy India. Alchemist
effort is a NATION WIDE MOVEMENT OF IMPORTANCE.
ALCHEMIST FLAGSHIP BRANDS:
IGTG FORTE:Alchemist Pharma Flagship brand, “IGTG FORTE” is a possible treatment for 108 Diseases including the
most dreaded viral diseases including Dengue, Chikungunya, Hepatitis, AIDS. Today when the world struggles to combat

re-think the treatment of Diabetes from a Chronic Reversible disease to a disease which may be reversed. This change of
approach for management of diabetes has happened for the first time in the world.
IGTG FORTE: INDIA’S 1st Wonder Pill
Alchemist Pharma Flagship brand IGTG FORTE has been acknowledged as India’s 1st Wonder Pill due to its use in
Difficult to Treat indications. The molecule “Bovine Colostrum” has been approved by USFDA as an Orphan Drug. Alchemist
brand IGTG FORTE has been used for treatment of difficult to treat diseases like Dengue Fever as all the recipients of this
drug have clinically registered 5 Fold platelet rise in just 7 days which hence may reduce the chances of platelet infusion
which is the only option in case platelets fall to abnormally low levels. IGTG FORTE is being used to treat Idiopathic
Infertility, not only the treatment with the brand is economical but the success rates are been compared to presently used
IVF therapy. The difference in cost is few thousands with IGTG FORTE vs Many Lacs with IVF. IGTG Forte is being used
as a support treatment to treat Arthritis, Cancer and even the most deadliest AIDS. In other words IGTG FORTE is a
solution to all Immuno-Compromised conditions and the confidence of doctors that it has gained through regular use in
patients and in clinic results have made them certify IGTG FORTE as India’s First Wonder Pill. Seeing the scope of
the indications and confidence of Doctors IGTG FORTE is expected to reach a market capitalization of over of 30
Crores in the next 2 years i.e. by 2020.

that’s where every third individual in a family is suffering. Alchemist is proud to have such a product called as Gasease.

AGRI BUSINESS
Domestic Market
Floriculture in India is being viewed as a high growth Industry. Indian Floriculture Market is growing at a Compounded
Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of about 25%. A strong increase in the demand for cut and loose flowers has made floriculture
as one of the important commercial trades in Indian agriculture. According to report, “ Indian Agriculture Market Report &
Forecast: (2018-2025) “, the demand for flowers is increasing robustly in India. While exports remain a key motivator for
cultivators, the domestic demand for flowers is also increasing exponentially, especially in the metros and larger cities.
Modernization and growing western cultural influences has driven consumers to buy flowers on a number of occasions
like valentine’s day, marriages, anniversaries, birthdays, friendship day, mother’s day, etc. Not only occasion’s flowers/
bouquets keep in demand throughout the year.
International Market
India is the second largest producer of flowers after China. Commercial floriculture is becoming important from the export
angle. The liberalization of industrial and trade policies have further paved the way for development of export-oriented
production of cut flowers. It has been found that commercial floriculture has higher potential per unit area than most of the
field crops and is therefore a lucrative business. The liberalized economy has given an impetus to the Indian entrepreneurs
for establishing export oriented floriculture units under controlled climatic conditions.

Steel wire is used to make barbed wire, razor wire, wire mesh, chain link fencing for Poultry and other wire fencing for
nonresidential and residential building applications. The value is projected to increase at an annualized rate of 8.2%,
fueling higher demand for wire fencing.
According to a market reports published by Transparency Market Research, “Fencing Market - Global Industry Analysis,
Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast, 2018-2022,” due to the slowdown in world economic growth, the Fencing industry
has suffered a certain impact, but still maintained a relatively optimistic growth. The metal fencing market is in a commanding
position owing to a wide range of products available under this category. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of
The global fencing market is largely driven by factors such as the rising consumer interest in home improvement and
home décor and the need for security and safety. Expanding residential construction and growing economies across the
globe are also supporting the growth of the fencing market. The increasing demand for residential fences and the growing
acceptance and popularity of synthetic alternatives will serve as an opportunity for the fencing industry. The global fencing
market is affected by the fluctuating raw material prices and the rising energy cost.
The fencing market is segmented into two major categories based on product type into agricultural wire fence and commercial
wire fence. Based on material type, the market is divided into four segments, namely metal, wood, plastic & composite and
concrete fencing. The end use segments covered in this report are residential, agricultural and the industrial sector. The

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
To the Members of Alchemist Limited
Report on the Audit of Standalone Financial Statements
Qualified Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Alchemist Limited (“the Company”), which comprise
the Balance Sheet as at 31st March, 2019, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the
Statement of Cash Flows and the Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and a summary of the significant
accounting policies and other explanatory information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, except for the effects of
the matter described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion section of our report, the aforesaid standalone financial
statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (‘Act’) in the manner so required and give a true and
fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India including Indian Accounting Standards
(‘Ind AS’) specified under section 133 of the Act, of the state of affairs (financial position) of the Company as at 31st March
2019, and its loss (financial performance including other comprehensive income), its cash flows and the changes in equity
for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Qualified Opinion
a.
Attention is invited to note no. 43 to the standalone financial statements which states that “The Company extends
credit from time to time as per market practices. In respect of export receivables’ amounting to ` 46,442.79 Lakhs,
credit was extended for export sales in the normal course of the business, however it apparently got stuck. Though the
Company is regularly following up on the same, has initiated legal recourse and is hopeful of recovering such amount,
still considering the principal of conservatism, the Company had made a provision for expected credit loss allowance
@ 10% of the outstanding export receivables amounting to ` 4,644.28 Lakhs and has not recognised unrealised
foreign exchange gain/loss on such export receivable and related trade payable during the financial year 2018-19.
Hence forth, the Company shall not be accounting for the unrealised foreign exchange loss on such export receivable
and related trade payables and the same will only be accounted for on actual realisation/payment”.
Such export receivables are outstanding for more than three years as at the year end date; provision @ 10%
is made against such doubtful trade receivables. Since the actual realisation of such doubtful export receivable
cannot be ascertained, we are unable to comment on the adequacy of the provision of excepted credit loss
made by the Company.
In the absence of the information on record, the consequential impact, if any, on the standalone financial
statements is not ascertainable.
Though, the Company admits that the export receivable is doubtful of recovery and has made partial provision
on such export receivable, still such export receivable and related trade payable stand in the books, hence
require recognition of unrealised foreign exchange gain/loss as per the provisions of Ind AS 21, The Effects of
Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. Accordingly, the loss is overstated by ` 2,242.60 Lakhs for the year
ended 31st March, 2019 and accordingly the trade receivables and trade payable are understated by ` 3,054.51
Lakhs and ` 811.91 Lakhs respectively, as at the year ended 31st March, 2019.
b.
Attention is invited to note no. 60 to the standalone financial statements which states that “The working capital limits
of ` 350.00 Lakhs availed from Bank of India for the working capital requirements of the pharmaceutical division has
been classified as non-performing asset (herein referred to as ‘NPA’) on 30th November, 2018. The outstanding as on
the date of classification by the bank as NPA was ` 363.88 Lakhs. The Company has not recognised interest liability
on such loan from the day it has become NPA, in line with the practice followed by the respective bank”.
The Company has not made provision of interest due on the borrowings from Bank of India, post the date the
account was classified as non-performing assets by the bank.
In the absence of the information on record, the consequential impact, if any, on the standalone financial
statements is not ascertainable.
c.
Attention is invited to note no. 10 and note no. 49 to the standalone financial statements which considers capital
advances of ` 769.70 lakhs as good and recoverable and also states that out of the same, the Company is pursuing
legal action in Honourable Kolkata High Court against Medisphere Marketing Limited for recovery of the amount of
` 459.80 Lakhs outstanding in its books. Further, The Company is hopeful of recovering the above amounts and
hence no provision is considered necessary.
Out of the total capital advances, capital advances of ` 755.07 Lakhs are outstanding for more than three
years as at the year end date and seems doubtful of recovery or adjustment, however, no provision is made
against such doubtful capital advances.

In the absence of the information on record, the consequential impact, if any, on the standalone financial
statements is not ascertainable.

Attention is invited to note no. 62 to the standalone financial statements which states that “The two subsidiaries
companies viz. Alchemist Infrastructure Private Limited and Alchemist Hospitality Group Limited are in the process of

` 4.74 Lakhs and ` 0.43 Lakhs respectively.
Our opinion is not qualified in respect of the matters as stated in the Emphasis of Matters paragraph.
Key Audit Matter
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the
standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the
standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion
on these matters. In addition to the matters described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion section, we have determined the
matter described below to be the key audit matter to be communicated in our report.
Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Going concern assessment
Attention is invited to note no. 62 to the standalone financial
statements which states that “The accumulated losses of the
Company had exceeded its net worth. The Company’s
operations were adversely affected in earlier financial years
due to sluggish market demand, working capital getting stuck
in trade receivables and loss making manufacturing activity
of the pharmaceutical unit. The Company has initiated legal
recourse against the defaulting customers and is regularly
following up on the same and the Company during the last
year has even closed down its loss making pharmaceutical
manufacturing. The units of the company now continue to
operate at satisfactory capacity utilization levels and are
generating positive Earnings before Interest Depreciation Tax
and Amortization (EBIDTA). With strong management focus
on strategic initiatives for cost rationalization, optimum
product mix and efficient plant operations, the management
believes that accumulated losses would reasonably be
paired, in due course. The standalone financial statements,
as such have been prepared on a going concern basis”.
The availability of sufficient funding and the testing of whether
the company will be able to continue meeting its obligations
under the financing covenants are important for the going
Our audit procedures were focused on obtaining sufficient
appropriate audit evidence that the going concern
assessment made by the Company is not materially
misstated. These procedures included, but were not limited
to, the following:
We analysed management’s report to gain an
understanding of the inputs and process underpinning the
cash flow model prepared for the purpose of the going
concern assessment.
We reviewed the operating performances of the various
units of the Company to evaluate whether or not they are
actually generating positive EBIDTA.
We assessed the possible mitigating actions identified by
management in the event that actual cash flows are below
forecast.

concern assumption and, as such, are significant aspects of
our audit. This test or assessment is largely based on the
expectations of and the estimates made by management.
The expectations and estimates can be influenced by
subjective elements such as estimated future cash flows,
forecasted results and margins from operations. Estimates
are based on assumptions, including expectations regarding
future developments in the economy and the market.
Information other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report thereon
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information
included in the Annual Report, but does not include the standalone financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form
of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and,
in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or
our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we
are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Management’s Responsibility for the Standalone Financial Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors are responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013
(“the Act”) with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the
financial position, financial performance including other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the
Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting
Standards (Ind AS) prescribed under section 133 of the Act.
This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the
Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection
and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring
the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone
financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern
basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic
alternative but to do so.
Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error,
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on
whether the company has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of
such controls.
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
disclosures made by management.

Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant
doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we
are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to
the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as
a going concern.
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and
whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair
presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of
the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our
audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be
thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most
significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or
when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to out weigh the public interest benefits of such
communication.

Annexure - B to the Independent Auditors' Report
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act,
2013 (""the Act"")
We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of Alchemist Limited (""the Company"") as of 31st
March, 2019 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the Company for the year ended on
that date.
Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the
internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of
internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ('ICAI'). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient
conduct of its business, including adherence to company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of
reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.
Auditors' Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls over financial reporting based on
our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over
Financial Reporting (the ""Guidance Note"") and the Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed
under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both
applicable to an audit of Internal Financial Controls and, both issued by the ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls
operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls
system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that
a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion
on the Company's internal financial controls system over financial reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting
A company's internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion
or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to
the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial
reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as at 31st March, 2019,
based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential
components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting
issued by the ICAI.

Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE). The Company is engaged in the business of Agriculture
and allied activities comprising of floriculture and manufacturing of wire mesh for poultry industry and trading of chemicals
and pharmaceutical formulations.
The standalone financial statements were approved for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Board of Directors of
the Company on 27th May, 2019.
Note 2 Basis of Preparation and Presentation
a)
Statement of compliance
These standalone financial statements are prepared on going concern basis following accrual system of accounting
and comply with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)
Rules, 2015 and subsequent amendments thereto, under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the”Act”). The
following note provides list of the significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented unless otherwise stated.
b)
Investments in subsidiaries and associates
Investments in subsidiary companies and associate company are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses,
if any. Where an indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investment is assessed and written down
immediately to its recoverable amount. On disposal of investments in subsidiary companies and associate company,
the difference between net disposal proceeds and the carrying amounts are recognised in the Statement of Profit and
Loss.
c)
Functional and presentation currency
The management has determined the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates
i.e., functional currency, to be ‘Indian Rupees’ [INR (`)]. The financial statements are presented in INR (`) which is
Company’s functional and presentational currency.
d)
Basis of measurement
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following items
Items
Measurement Basis
Certain financial assets and liabilities
Fair value
Net defined benefit (asset)/ liability
Fair value of plan assets less present
value of defined benefit obligations
e)
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In preparing these financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect
the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognized prospectively.
Judgements
Information about judgements made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the
amounts recognized in the financial statements is included in the following notes:
Note 3 (n) - whether the Company acts as a principal rather than as an agent in a transaction;
Note 3 (p) - leases: whether an arrangement contains a lease;
Note 3 (p) - lease classification; and
Note 3 (d) and 43 - classification of financial assets: assessment of business model within which the assets are held
and assessment of whether the contractual terms of the financial asset are solely payments of principal and interest
on the principal amount outstanding.
Assumptions and estimation uncertainties
Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material
adjustment in the year ending 31st March, 2019 is included in the following notes:

Note 3 (k) - measurement of defined benefit obligations and plan assets: key actuarial assumptions;
Note 3 (g) - measurement of useful lives and residual values to property, plant and equipment;
Note 3 (h) - measurement of useful lives of intangible assets;
Note 3 (l), and 3 (m) - recognition and measurement of provisions and contingencies: key assumptions about the
likelihood and magnitude of an outflow of resources; and
Note 3 (r) - recognition of deferred tax assets: availability of future taxable profit against which tax losses carried
forward can be used and MAT credit entitlement.
Note 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
This note provides a list of the significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these standalone financial
statements. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
The Company has elected to utilise the option underInd AS 101 by not applying the provisions of Ind AS 16 and Ind AS 38
retrospectively and continue to use the previous GAAP carrying amount as a deemed cost under Ind AS at the date of
transition to IndAS i.e. 1st April 2016. Therefore, the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible
assets as per the previous GAAP as at 1st April 2016, i.e. the Company’s date of transition to Ind AS, were maintained on
transition to Ind AS.
a)
Current and non-current classification
All assets and liabilities are classified into current and non-current.
Assets
An asset is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:
It is expected to be realised in, or is intended for sale or consumption in, the Company’s normal operating cycle;
It is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
It is expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting date; or
It is cash or cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 12
months after the reporting date.
Current assets include the current portion of non-current financial assets. All other assets are classified as non-
current.
Liabilities
A liability is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:
It is expected to be settled in the Company’s normal operating cycle;
It is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
It is due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting date; or
The Company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after
the reporting period. Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the
issue of equity instruments do not affect its classification.
Current liabilities include the current portion of financial liabilities some part of which may be noncurrent. All other
liabilities are classified as non-current.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.
Operating cycle
The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realization in cash or cash
equivalents. Based on the nature of operations and the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and
their realization in cash and cash equivalents, the Company has ascertained its operating cycle being a period of 12
months for the purpose of classification of assets and liabilities as current and non- current.
b)
Foreign currency transactions and translations
Monetary and non-monetary transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency of the
Company at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions or at an average rate if the average rate approximates
the actual rate at the date of the transaction. Monetary foreign currency assets and liabilities remaining unsettled on
reporting date are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing on reporting date. Gains/(losses) arising on account
of realisation/settlement of foreign exchange transactions and on translation of monetary foreign currency assets and
liabilities are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
c)
Fair value measurement
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction

between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that
the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either
In the principal market for the asset or liability, or
In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to/ by the Company.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when
pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value
measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits
by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in
its highest and best use.
The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are
available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable
inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised
within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement as a whole
Level 1 – Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is
directly or indirectly observable;
Level 3 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is
unobservable.
d)
Financial instruments
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity
instrument of another entity.
i.
Financial assets
Recognition and initial measurement
All financial assets are initially recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of
the instrument. All financial assets are initially measured at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not
recorded at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial
asset.
Classification and subsequent measurement
Classification
For the purpose of subsequent measurement, the Company classifies financial assets in following categories:
Financial assets at amortised cost;
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)
A financial asset being ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the amortised cost if both of the following conditions are
met
The financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual
cash flows; and
The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments
of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.
A financial asset being equity instrument is measured at FVTPL.
All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost are measured at FVTPL. On initial recognition,
the Company may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured
at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch
that would otherwise arise.
Subsequent measurement
Financial assets at amortised cost: These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses, if any. Interest income and impairment are
recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
Financial assets at FVTPL: These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including
any interest income, are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

Derecognition
The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial
asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially
all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Company neither
transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the
financial asset. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
Impairment
The Company recognizes loss allowances using the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model for the financial assets
which are not fair valued through profit or loss. Loss allowance for trade receivables with no significant financing
component is measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. For all other financial assets, expected credit losses
are measured at an amount equal to the 12-month ECL, unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk
from initial recognition, in which case those financial assets are measured at lifetime ECL. The changes (incremental
or reversal) in loss allowance computed using ECL model, is recognised as an impairment gain or loss in the
statement of profit and loss.
Write-off
The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no
realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when the Company determines that the counterparty
does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject
to the write-off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in
order to comply with the Company’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.
ii.
Financial liabilities
Recognition and initial measurement
All financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of
the instrument. All financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value minus, in the case of financial liabilities
not recorded at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the liability.
Classification and subsequent measurement
Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Interest
expense are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised
in the statement of profit and loss.
Derecognition
The Company derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or
expire.
The Company also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows under the
modified terms are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on modified terms is recognised
at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability extinguished and the new
financial liability with modified terms is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
iii.
Offsetting
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when, and
only when, the Company currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to
settle them on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
e)
Equity share capital
Proceeds from issuance of ordinary shares are recognised as equity share capital in equity. Incremental costs directly
attributable to the issuance of new equity shares are recognized as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.
f)
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, bank balances and any deposits with original maturities of three
months or less (that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and cash equivalents and subject to an
insignificant risk of changes in value). However, for the purpose of the statement of cash flows, in addition to above
items, any bank overdrafts / cash credits that are integral part of the Company’s cash management, are also included
as a component of cash and cash equivalents.
g)
Property, plant and equipment
Recognition and measurement
An item is recognised as an asset, if and only if, it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the

item will flow to the Company and its cost can be measured reliably. PPE are initially recognized at cost. The initial
cost of PPE comprises its purchase price (including non-refundable duties and taxes but excluding any trade discounts
and rebates), and any directly attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition and location for its
intended use. In case of multiple element contracts whereby the vendor supplies PPE as well as other components,
PPE is recorded on the basis of relative fair values.
Cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price, including import duties and non-
refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates, any directly attributable cost of bringing the
item to its working condition for its intended use and estimated costs of dismantling and removing the item and
restoring the site on which it is located.
The cost of a self-constructed item of property, plant and equipment comprises the cost of materials and direct labor,
any other costs directly attributable to bringing the item to working condition for its intended use, and estimated costs
of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located.
Subsequent to initial recognition, PPE are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.
When significant parts of property, plant and equipment are required to be replaced in regular intervals, the Company
recognises such parts as separate component of assets. When an item of PPE is replaced, then its carrying amount
is de-recognised from the balance sheet and cost of the new item of PPE is recognised. Further, in case the replaced
part was not being depreciated separately, the cost of the replacement is used as an indication to determine the cost
of the replaced part at the time it was acquired.
If significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, then they are accounted for
as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.
The expenditures that are incurred after the item of PPE has been put to use, such as repairs and maintenance, are
normally charged to the statement of profit and loss in the period in which such costs are incurred. However, in
situations where the said expenditure can be measured reliably, and is probable that future economic benefits associated
with it will flow to the Company, it is included in the asset’s carrying value or as a separate asset, as appropriate.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets (other than freehold land and properties under
construction) less their residual values over their useful lives, using the straight-line method (SLM). The estimated
useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect
of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.
Depreciation is charged on a pro-rata basis at the straight line method over estimated economic useful lives of its
property, plant and equipment generally in accordance with that provided in the Schedule II to the Act other than
sapling which are depreciated over a period of 7 years with nil residual value.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are
expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item
of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount
of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are included in
the statement of profit and loss within other gains/(losses).
Capital work-in-progress includes assets under construction and cost attributable to construction of assets not ready
for use before the year end.
h)
Intangible assets
Recognition and measurement
Intangible assets are recognised if it is probable that the future economic benefits attributable to the assets will flow
to the enterprise and cost of the asset can be measured reliably in accordance with the notified Indian Accounting
Standard – 38 on ‘Intangible Assets’.
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, intangible
assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific
asset to which it relates.
Amortisation
a.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever
there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired;
b.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed
at least at the end of each reporting period;

c.
Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied
in the asset are considered to modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as
changes in accounting estimates.
1.
Computer Software
Softwares are amortised over the period of license, generally not exceeding ten years.
2.
Research & Development
Research & Development are amortised over the period of ten years.
3.
Pan India Distribution Network
Pan India Distribution Network are amortised over the period of ten years.
i)
Inventories
Raw materials and packing materials are valued at lower of cost and net realisable value after providing for
obsolescence, if any. Cost is determined on the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method. Obsolete/ non-moving inventories are
valued at net realisable value.
Inventory costs include purchase price, freight inward, transit insurance charges and non-refundable taxes. Net realizable
value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the
estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Work-in-process, stores, spares and consumables, stock-in-trade and finished goods are valued at lower of cost and
net realisable value.
j)
Impairment of non-financial assets
The Company assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any
indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Company estimates the asset’s
recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) fair
value less costs of disposal and its value in use.
Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash in flows that are
largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU
exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses, if any, are recognised in statement of profit and loss.
Reversal of impairment losses
Impairment losses are reversed and the carrying value is increased to its revised recoverable amount provided that
this amount does not exceed the carrying value that would have been determined had no impairment loss been
recognised for the said asset in previous years.
k)
Employee benefits
The Company’s employee benefits mainly include wages, salaries, bonuses, defined contribution to plans, defined
benefit plans, compensated absences, deferred compensation and share-based payments. The employee benefits
are recognised in the year in which the associated services are rendered by the Company employees.
i.
Short-term obligations
All employee benefits payable/ available within twelve months of rendering the service such as salaries, wages
and bonus etc., are classified as short-term employee benefits and are recognised in the statement of profit and
loss in the period in which the employee renders the related service.
ii.
Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into
a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for
contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in the statement of
profit and loss in the periods during which the related services are rendered by employees. The Company makes
specified contributions towards the following schemes:
Employees’ Provident Fund
The Company makes contribution to statutory provident fund in accordance with Employees’ Provident Fund and
Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952. The plan is a defined contribution plan and contribution paid or payable is
recognized as an expense in the period in which services are rendered by the employee.
Employees’ State Insurance
The Company makes contribution to Employee State Insurance scheme in accordance with Employees’ State
Insurance Act, 1948. The scheme is a self-financing social security and health insurance scheme for workers and

contribution paid or payable is recognized as an expense in the period in which services are rendered by the
employee.
iii.
Defined benefit plans
A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan.
Gratuity
The Company provides for gratuity, a defined benefit plan (the Gratuity Plan) covering all directly recruited eligible
employees. In accordance with the payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, the Gratuity plan provides a lump sum payment
to vested employees on retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of employment.
The calculation of defined benefit obligation is performed annually by a qualified actuary separately for each plan
using the projected unit credit method, which recognises each year of service as giving rise to additional unit of
employee benefit entitlement and measures each unit separately to build up the final obligation.
The obligation is measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows. The discount rates used for
determining the present value of obligation under defined benefit plans, is based on the market yields on
Government securities as at the balance sheet date, having maturity periods approximating to the terms of
related obligations.
Re-measurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts
included in net interest on the net defined benefit, are recognised immediately in the balance sheet acor responding
debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which they occur.
Re-measurements are not reclassified to the statement of profit and loss in subsequent periods.
The Company determines the net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the
period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual
period to the then-net defined benefit liability (asset), taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit
liability (asset) during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net interest expense and
other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
l)
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past
event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation
and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are measured at management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation
at the end of the reporting period. If, the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using
a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the
increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
m) Contingent liabilities
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company or
a present obligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic
benefits will be required to settle the obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient
reliability. Information on contingent liabilities is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements, unless the possibility
of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote.
n)
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company, and the
revenue can be reliably measured regardless of when the payment is being made. Revenue excludes goods and
service tax which are collected by the Company on behalf of the Government and deposited to the credit of respective
Governments.
Ind AS 115, is effective for periods beginning on or after April 01, 2018. Ind AS 115 sets out the requirements for
recognising revenue that apply to all contracts with customers (except for contracts that are within the scope of the
Standards on leases, insurance contracts and financial instruments). Ind AS 115 replaces the previous revenue
Standards: Ind AS 18 Revenue and Ind AS 11 Construction Contracts, and the related appendices.
The standard establishes a comprehensive framework for determining when to recognise revenue and how much
revenue to recognise. Under Ind AS 115, an entity recognises revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is
satisfied, i.e. when ‘control’ of the goods or services underlying the particular performance obligation is transferred to
the customer. The core principle in that framework is that a company should recognise revenue to depict the transfer
of promised goods or services tothe customer in an amount that reflects the fair value of consideration to which the
Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services.

Specifically, the standard introduces a 5-step approach to revenue recognition:
Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer;
Step 2: Identify the performance obligation in contract;
Step 3: Determine the transaction price;
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
The Company has adopted Ind AS 115 “Revenue from contracts with customers” using the cumulative effect method,
with the effect of initially applying this standard recognised at the date of initial application (i.e. 1st April, 2018). Under
this transition method, the comparative information is not restated – i.e. the comparative information continues to be
reported under Ind AS 18 “Revenue recognition and related interpretations”. The adoption of the standard did not
have any material impact on the financial statements of the Company since as per the Company’s current revenue
recognition practices, transfer of control happens at the same point as transfer of risk and rewards thus not effecting
the revenue recognition. The amount of revenue recognised reflects the consideration to which the Company expects
to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Therefore, the accounting changes required by the standard
are not having material effect on the Company’s financial statements and no transitional adjustment is recognised in
retained earnings at 1stApril, 2018.
Sale of Products
Revenue from sale of products is recognized when the control on the goods have been transferred to the customer.
The performance obligation in case of sale of product is satisfied at a point in time i.e., when the material is shipped
to the customer or on delivery to the customer, as may be specified in the contract.
Contract assets
A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer. If the
Company performs by transferring goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before
payment is due, a contract asset is recognized for the earned consideration that is conditional.
Trade receivables
A receivable represents the Company’s right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the passage
of time is required before payment of the consideration is due).
Contract liabilities
A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Company has received
consideration from the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the Company transfers goods or services to
the customer, a contract liability is recognized when the payment isreceived.
Interest income
Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the
Company and the amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on, time basis, by reference
to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts
estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount on
initial recognition.
Dividend income
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholder’s right to receive payment has been established.
o)
Government grants
Government Grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all
attached conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an asset, it is recognised as income in equal
amounts over the expected useful life of the related asset.
When the Company receives grants of non-monetary assets, the asset and the grant are recorded at fair value
amounts and released to profit and loss accounts over the expected useful life in a pattern of consumption of the
benefit of the underlying asset i.e. by equal annual installments. When loans or similar assistance are provided by the
government or related institutions, with an interest rate below the current applicable market rate, the effect of this
favourable interest is regarded as a government grant.
p)
Leases
i.
Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of an arrangement
at inception date: whether fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and
the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset, even if that right is not explicitly specified in an arrangement.

At inception or on reassessment of the arrangement that contains a lease, the payments and other consideration
required by such an arrangement are separated into those for the lease and those for other elements on the
basis of their relative fair values.
ii.
Where the Company is the lessee
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Company as
lessee are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received
from the lessor) are charged to the statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the
lease unless the payments are structured to increase in line with expected general inflation to compensate for the
lessor’s expected inflationary cost increases.
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Company, as lessee, has substantially all the risks and
rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the lease’s inception at
the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding
rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in borrowings or other financial liabilities as appropriate.
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to the statement
of profit and loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining
balance of the liability for each period.
Leased assets are depreciated on WDV method over the useful life of the asset. However, if there is no reasonable
certainty that the company will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated on WDV
method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.
iii.
Where the Company is the lessor
Leases in which the Company does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of
the asset are classified as operating leases. Lease income from operating leases where the Company is a lessor
is recognised in income on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless the receipts are structured to increase
in line with expected general inflation to compensate for the expected inflationary cost increases. The respective
leased assets are included in the balance sheet based on their nature.
q)
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are interest and other costs incurred in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing costs (for
general and specific borrowings) directly attributable to acquisition or construction of an asset which necessarily take
a substantial period of time (qualifying assets) to get ready for their intended use are capitalised as part of the cost of
that asset. Other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying
assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
r)
Income tax
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. It is recognised in statement of profit and loss, except to the
extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.
Current tax
Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any
adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax reflects the best
estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received after considering the uncertainty, if any, related to income
taxes. It is measured using tax rates (and tax laws) enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset only if there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised
amounts, and it is intended to realise the asset and settle the liability on a net basis or simultaneously.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences to
the extent that is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Future taxable
profits are determined based on reversal of temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting
date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised; such
reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognized to the extent that it has
become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred tax is measured
at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on
the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the
Company expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and
assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities
and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.
Minimum Alternative Tax (‘MAT’) expense under the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 is recognised as an asset
when it is probable that future economic benefit associated with it in the form of adjustment of future income tax
liability, will flow to the Company and the asset can be measured reliably. MAT credit entitlement is set off to the extent
allowed in the year in which the Company becomes liable to pay income taxes at the enacted tax rates. MAT credit
entitlement is reviewed at each reporting date and is written down to reflect the amount that is reasonably certain to
be set off in future years against the future income tax liability. MAT Credit Entitlement has been presented as Deferred
Tax in Balance Sheet.
s)
Earnings per share
The Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its equity shares. Basic EPS is calculated
by dividing the profit or loss attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of
equity shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the parent (after adjusting
for interest on the convertible preference shares) by the weighted average number of Equity shares outstanding
during the year plus the weighted average number of Equity shares that would be issued on conversion of all the
dilutive potential Equity shares into Equity shares.
t)
Segment reporting
Information reported to the Board of Directors who is chief operating decision maker (CODM) for the purposes of
resources allocation and assessment of segment performance focuses on the types of services provided. The Board
of Directors of the Company have chosen to organise the Company around the different services being provided.
Operating segments have been aggregated based on similar risk and reward and on fulfilment of other aggregation
criteria.
CODM has identified primary segment which consists of ‘Agri Business’, and ‘Pharma, Chemical and Minerals’.
The following specific accounting policies have been followed for segment reporting:
i.
Segment revenue includes sales and other income directly identifiable with the segment including intersegment
revenue;
ii.
Expenses that are directly identifiable with the segments are considered for determining the segment results.
Expenses which relate to the Group as a whole and not allocable to segments are included under unallocable
expenditure;
iii.
Income which relates to the Group as a whole and not allocable to segments is included in unallocable income;
and
iv.
Segment assets and liabilities include those directly identifiable with the respective segments. Un-allocable
corporate assets and liabilities represent the assets and liabilities that relate to the Company as a whole and not
allocable to any segment.
u)
Recent Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS)
Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”), through Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2019
and Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)Second Amendment Rules, has notified the following new and
amendments to Ind ASs which the Company has not applied as they are effective from April 1, 2019:
Ind AS 116 – Leases
Ind AS 116 will replace the existing leases standard, Ind AS 17 Leases. Ind AS 116 sets out the principles for the
recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors. It introduces a single,
on-balance sheet lessee accounting model for lessees. A lessee recognises right-of-use asset representing its right
to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. The standard also
contains enhanced disclosure requirements for lessees. Ind AS 116 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting
requirements in Ind AS 17.
The Company will adopt Ind AS 116, effective annual reporting period beginning April 1, 2019. The Company will
apply the standard to its leases, retrospectively,with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard, recognised
on the date of initial application (April 1, 2019). Accordingly, the Company will not restate comparative information,
instead, the cumulative effect of initially applying this Standard will be recognised as an adjustment to the opening
balance of retained earnings as on April 1, 2019. On that date, the Company will recognise a lease liability measured

at the present value of the remaining lease payments. The right-of-use asset is recognised at its carrying amount as
if the standard had been applied since the commencement date, but discounted using the lessee’s incremental
borrowing rate as at 1st April, 2019. In accordance with the standard, the Company will elect not to apply the requirements
of Ind AS 116 to short-term leases andleases for which the underlying asset is of low value. Alchemist does not
expect this amendment to have any significant impact on its financial statements.
On transition, the Company will be using the practical expedient provided the standard and therefore, will not reassess
whether a contract, is or contains a lease, at the date of initial application.
Ind AS 12 – Income taxes (amendments relating to income tax consequences of dividend and uncertainty
over income tax treatments)
The amendment relating to income tax consequences of dividend clarify that an entity shall recognise the income tax
consequences of dividends in profit or loss,other comprehensive income or equity according to where the entity
originally recognised those past transactions or events. The Company does not expect any impact from this
pronouncement. It is relevant to note that the amendment does not amend situations where the entity pays a tax on
dividend which is effectively a portion of dividends paid to taxation authorities on behalf of shareholders. Such amount
paid or payable to taxation authorities continues to be charged to equity as part of dividend, in accordance with Ind
AS 12.
The amendment to Appendix C of Ind AS 12 specifies that the amendment is to be applied to the determination of
taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, when there is uncertainty over
income tax treatments under Ind AS 12. It outlines the following: (1) the entity has to use judgement, to determine
whether each tax treatment should be considered separately or whether some can be considered together. The
decision should be based on the approach which provides better predictions of the resolution of the uncertainty (2)
the entity is to assume that the taxation authority will have full knowledge of all relevant information while examining
any amount (3) entity has to consider the probability of the relevant taxation authority accepting the tax treatment and
the determination of taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates would
depend upon the probability. Alchemist does not expect any significant impact of the amendment on its financial
statements.
Ind AS 109 – Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation
The amendments relate to the existing requirements in Ind AS 109 regarding termination rights in order to allow
measurement at amortised cost (or, depending onthe business model, at fair value through other comprehensive
income) even in the case of negative compensation payments. Alchemist does not expect this amendment to have
any impact on its financial statements.
Ind AS 19 – Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement
The amendments clarify that if a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement occurs, it is mandatory that the current
service cost and the net interest for the period after the re-measurement are determined using the assumptions used
for the re-measurement. In addition, amendments have been included to clarify the effect of a plan amendment,
curtailment or settlement on the requirements regarding the asset ceiling. Alchemist does not expect this amendment
to have any significant impact on its financial statements.
Ind AS 23 – Borrowing Costs
The amendments clarify that if any specific borrowing remains outstanding after the related asset is ready for its
intended use or sale, that borrowing becomes part of the funds that an entity borrows generally when calculating the
capitalization rate on general borrowings. Alchemist does not expect any impact from this amendment.
Ind AS 28 – Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures
The amendments clarify that an entity applies Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments, to long-term interests in an associate
or joint venture that form part of the net investment in the associate or joint venture but to which the equity method is
not applied. Alchemsit does not expect any impact from this amendment.
Ind AS 103 – Business Combinations and Ind AS 111 – Joint Arrangements
The amendments to Ind AS 103 relating to re-measurement clarify that when an entity obtains control of a business
that is a joint operation, it re-measures previously held interests in that business. The amendments to Ind AS 111
clarify that when an entity obtains joint control of a business that is a joint operation, the entity does not re-measure
previously held interests in that business. Alchemist will apply the pronouncement if and when it obtains control / joint
control of a business that is a joint operation.
v)
Policies not specifically mentioned are consistent with generally accepted accounting principles.

Financial Risk Management
The Company's financial risk management is an integral part of how to plan and execute its business strategies. The
Company has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments:
Credit risk;
Liquidity risk; and
Market risk
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to
the Company. The Company has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of
mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The Company's exposure and wherever appropriate, the credit
ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and spread amongst various counterparties. Credit exposure
is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by the management of the Company. Financial
instruments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk, principally consist of balance with banks, investments in
debt instruments/ bonds, trade receivables, loans and advances and derivative financial instruments. None of the
financial instruments of the Company result in material concentrations of credit risks.
Balances with banks were not past due or impaired as at the year end. In other financial assets that are not past dues
and not impaired, there were no indication of default in repayment as at the year end.
The age analysis of trade receivables as of the balance sheet date have been considered from the due date and is as
reflected below.

The Company extends credit from time to time as per market practices. In respect of export receivables amounting to
` 46,442.79 Lakhs, credit was extended for export sales in the normal course of the business, however it apparently
got stuck. Though the Company is regularly following up on the same, has initiated legal recourse and is hopeful of
recovering such amount, still considering the principal of conservatism, the Company had made a provision for
expected credit loss allowance @ 10% of the outstanding export receivables amounting to ` 4,644.28 Lakhs and has
not recognised unrealised foreign exchange gain/loss on such export receivable and related trade payable during the
financial year 2018-19. Hence forth, the Company shall not be accounting for the unrealised foreign exchange loss on
such export receivable and related trade payables and the same will only be accounted for on actual realisation/
payment.

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its
financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company's approach to managing
liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are fallen
due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the
Company's reputation.
The Company believes that its liquidity position, including total cash and cash equivalent and bank balances other
than cash and cash equivalent of ` 224.75 Lakhs as at 31st March 2019 (31st March 2018 ` 269.29 Lakhs), and
anticipated future internally generated funds from operations will enable it to meet its future known obligations in the
ordinary course of business. However, if a liquidity needs were to arise, the Company believes it has access to
financing arrangements, value of unencumbered assets, which should enable it to meet its ongoing capital, operating,
and other liquidity requirements. The Company will continue to consider various borrowing or leasing options to
maximize liquidity and supplement cash requirements as necessary.

Market risk
Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair value or future cash flows arising out of change in the price of a
financial instrument. These include change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange
rates, equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable
to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including investments and deposits, foreign currency receivables,
payables and loans and borrowings.
The Company manages market risk through a risk management committee engaged in, inter alia, evaluation and
identification of risk factors with the object of governing/ mitigating them according to Company's objectives and
declared policies in specific context of impact thereof on various segments of financial instruments. The Board provides
oversight and reviews the Risk management policy on a quarterly basis.

NOTES FORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, CONTD.
a)
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because
of changes in market interest rates. In order to balance the Company's position with regards to interest income
and interest expense and to manage the interest rate risk, treasury performs a comprehensive interest rate risk
management.
The Company is not exposed to significant interest rate risk as at the respective reporting dates.
b)
Foreign currency risk management
The Company is no longer undertaking transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently, exposures
to exchange rate fluctuations will not arise in the future. Presently, however,the Company does have foreign
currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the end of the reporting period and their
carrying amounts are as follows.

In respect of above mentioned export receivables, credit was extended for export sales in the normal course of
the business, however it apparently got stuck. Though the Company is regularly following up on the same, has
initiated legal recourse and is hopeful of recovering such amount, still considering the principal of conservatism,
the Company had made a provision for expected credit loss @ 10% of the outstanding export receivables and
has not recognised unrealised foreign exchange gain/loss on such export receivable and related trade payable
during the financial year 2018-19. Hence forth, the Company shall not be accounting for the unrealised foreign
exchange loss on such export receivable and related trade payables and the same will only be accounted for on
actual realisation/payment.
c)
Foreign currency sensitivity
Since the Company is not recognizing unrealised foreign exchange gain/loss on outstanding monetary assets
and liabilities, hence, there is no need to disclose the foreign currency sensitivity.

Scale Enterprises, so as to disclose the information as required by MSMED Act relating to Micro, Small and Medium

classification of Poultry Keeping Machinery under Chapter 73 of the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 and had demanded
the duty of ` 173.55 Lakhs plus interest and penalty by invoking the extended period of limitation for 5 years. However,
the Company had cleared the goods as Poultry Keeping Machinery classifying the goods at -Nil- rate of duty under
Chapter 84 of the CET Act, 1985.
This matter was pending with CESTAT and during the year 2017-18, the CESTAT had given a decision in the favor of
the Company. The revenue authorities have gone into an appeal against this order, during the year 2018-19. The

Company has already paid the duty of ` 63.13 lakhs against the above demand as 'Duty Paid Under Protest', hence,
the balance un-deposited amount of ` 110.42 lacs has been shown as a contingent liability.
Also the additional amount paid subsequent to the demand and till 31st March, 2013 was deposited under protest,
thereby cumulating to ` 92.29 Lakhs. Further, the department issued a shown cause notice demanding a duty of `
18.12 lakhs for the duty short paid during the period from 1st September, 2016 to 30th June, 2017, which is also been
paid under protest during the year 2018-19. Therefore, the total duty of ` 110.41 Lakhs already paid under protest has
been shown as 'Amount recoverable in cash or in kind' in the standalone financial statements under the head Current
Loan.
With regard to the duty paid under protest to the tune of ` 92.29 Lakhs, the Company had approached the revenue
authorities for refund of the said amount, however, the same has been denied, against which the Company has gone
into an appeal with CESTAT. The Company as of now has not demanded the refund of balance amount of ` 18.12
Lakhs paid under protest, pending the outcome of the decision of the Supreme Court.
56. Financial reporting of interest in Joint Venture - Indian Accounting Standard 111 (Ind AS 111)
Advance received include ` 1,077.51 Lakhs (previous year ` 1,168.24 Lakhs) as advance received against joint

search and seizure operation u/s 132 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 during the month of June, 2014.
58. The accumulated losses of the Company had exceeded its net worth. The Company's operations were adversely
affected in earlier financial years due to sluggish market demand, working capital getting stuck in trade receivables
and loss making manufacturing activity of the pharmaceutical unit. The Company has initiated legal recourse against
the defaulting customers and is regularly following up on the same and the Company during the last year has even
closed down its loss making pharmaceutical manufacturing. The units of the company now continue to operate at
satisfactory capacity utilization levels and are generating positive Earnings before Interest Depreciation Tax and
Amortization (EBIDTA). With strong management focus on strategic initiatives for cost rationalization, optimum product
mix and efficient plant operations, the management believes that accumulated losses would reasonably be paired, in
due course. The standalone financial statements, as such have been prepared on a going concern basis.
59. An unclaimed dividend pertaining to dividend declared for the year 2010-11 amounting to ` 8.77 Lakhs (Previous Year
` 7.94 Lakhs) was transferred to investor education and protection fund during the year 2018-19.
60. The working capital limits of ` 350.00 Lakhs availed from Bank of India for the working capital requirements of the
pharmaceutical division has been classified as non-performing asset (herein referred to as 'NPA') on 30th November,
2018. The outstanding as on the date of classification by the bank as NPA was ` 363.88 Lakhs. The Company has not
recognised interest liability on such loan from the day it has become NPA, in line with the practice followed by the
respective bank.

Lakhs in lieu of the assessment carried out by the income tax departments for the assessments years 2009-10 to
2015-16. The Company has not provided for such liability in its books as it shall appeal such demand raised by the
income tax department. Since the order was served on the Company on 3rd May, 2019, the Company has still time to
appeal against such order.
62. The two subsidiaries companies viz. Alchemist Infrastructure Private Limited and Alchemist Hospitality Group Limited
are in the process of voluntary strike off. The forms required to be filed with the Registrar of Companies have been
filed and approval is awaited. Hence, the Company has written off the investment and loans extended to such
subsidiaries amounting to ` 4.74 Lakhs and ` 0.43 Lakhs respectively.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
To the Members of Alchemist Limited
Report on the Audit of Consolidated Financial Statements
Qualified Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Alchemist Limited (“the Holding Company”) and
its subsidiaries and associates (the Holding Company, its subsidiaries and associates together referred to as ‘the Group’),
which comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31st March, 2019, the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss
(including Other Comprehensive Income), the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and the Consolidated Statement of
Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and a summary of the significant accounting policies and other explanatory
information.
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us and based on the consideration
of the reports of the other auditors on separate financial statements and on the other financial information of the subsidiaries
and associates, except for the effects of the matter described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion section of our
report, the aforesaid consolidated financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (‘Act’)
in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in
India including Indian Accounting Standards (‘Ind AS’) specified under section 133 of the Act, of the state of affairs
(financial position) of the Group as at 31st March 2019, and its loss (financial performance including other comprehensive
income), its cash flows and the changes in equity for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Qualified Opinion
a.
It has been explained to us that the financial statements of one associate, ROC Foods Limited is still under
compilation and two subsidiaries viz. Alchemist Infrastructure Private Limited and Alchemist Hospitality Group
Limited are under strike off. Accordingly, the same are not forming part of the consolidated financial results.
b.
Attention is invited to note no. 43 to the consolidated financial statements in respect of the Holding Company, which
states that “The Company extends credit from time to time as per market practices. In respect of export receivables’
amounting to ` 46,442.79 Lakhs, credit was extended for export sales in the normal course of the business, however
it apparently got stuck. Though the Company is regularly following up on the same, has initiated legal recourse and is
hopeful of recovering such amount, still considering the principal of conservatism, the Company had made a provision
for expected credit loss allowance @ 10% of the outstanding export receivables amounting to ` 4,644.28 Lakhs and
has not recognised unrealised foreign exchange gain/loss on such export receivable and related trade payable during
the financial year 2018-19. Hence forth, the Company shall not be accounting for the unrealised foreign exchange
loss on such export receivable and related trade payables and the same will only be accounted for on actual realisation/
payment”.
Such export receivables are outstanding for more than three years as at the year end date; provision @ 10%
is made against such doubtful trade receivables. Since the actual realisation of such doubtful export receivable
cannot be ascertained, we are unable to comment on the adequacy of the provision of excepted credit loss
made by the Holding Company.
In the absence of the information on record, the consequential impact, if any, on the consolidated financial
statements is not ascertainable.
Though, the Holding Company admits that the export receivable is doubtful of recovery and has made partial
provision on such export receivable, still such export receivable and related trade payable stand in the books,
hence require recognition of unrealised foreign exchange gain/loss as per the provisions of Ind AS 21, The
Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. Accordingly, the loss is overstated by ` 2,242.60 Lakhs for the
year ended 31st March, 2019 and accordingly the trade receivables and trade payable are understated by
` 3,054.51 Lakhs and ` 811.91 Lakhs respectively, as at the year ended 31st March, 2019.
c.
Attention is invited to note no. 60 to the consolidated financial statements in respect of the Holding Company, which
states that “The working capital limits of ` 350.00 Lakhs availed from Bank of India for the working capital requirements
of the pharmaceutical division has been classified as non-performing asset (herein referred to as ‘NPA’) on 30th
November, 2018. The outstanding as on the date of classification by the bank as NPA was ` 363.88 Lakhs. The Parent
has not recognised interest liability on such loan from the day it has become NPA, in line with the practice followed by
the respective bank”.
The Holding Company has not made provision of interest due on the borrowings from Bank of India, post the
date the account was classified as non-performing assets by the bank.
In the absence of the information on record, the consequential impact, if any, on the consolidated financial

statements is not ascertainable.
d.
Attention is invited to note no. 10 and note no. 49 to the consolidated financial statements which considers capital
advances of ` 769.70 lakhs as good and recoverable and also states that out of the same, the Parent is pursuing legal
action in Honorable Kolkata High Court against Medisphere Marketing Limited for recovery of the amount of ` 459.80
Lakhs outstanding in its books. Further, the Parent is hopeful of recovering the above amounts and hence no provision
is considered necessary.
Out of the total capital advances, capital advances of ` 755.07 Lakhs are outstanding for more than three
years as at the year end date and seems doubtful of recovery or adjustment, however, no provision is made
against such doubtful capital advances.
In the absence of the information on record, the consequential impact, if any, on the consolidated financial
statements is not ascertainable.
Emphasis of Matters

Attention is invited to note no. 61 to the consolidated financial statements in respect of the Holding Company, which
states that “The income tax department has through its order dated 7th February, 2019 has demanded an amount of
` 29,129.34 Lakhs in lieu of the assessment carried out by the income tax departments for the assessments years
2009-10 to 2015-16. The Company has not provided for such liability in its books as it shall appeal such demand
raised by the income tax department. Since the order was served on the Company on 3rd May, 2019, the Company
has still time to appeal against such order”.
b.

states that “The pharma division of the Parent has adjusted trade payables amounting to ` 1,021.40 Lakhs (Previous
Year ` 1,095.58 Lakhs) by way of a book entry on account of direct payment to them by some trade receivables or by

Attention is invited to note no. 53 to the consolidated financial statements which states that “The balances of majority

unascertainable”.
Our opinion is not qualified in respect of the matters as stated in the Emphasis of Matters paragraph.
Key Audit Matter
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the
consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the
consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate
opinion on these matters. In addition to the matters described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion section we have determined
the matter described below to be the key audit matter to be communicated in our report.
Key audit matter
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Going concern assessment
Attention is invited to note no. 58 to the consolidated financial
statements which states that “The accumulated losses of the
Group had exceeded its net worth. The Group’s operations
were adversely affected in earlier financial years due to
sluggish market demand, working capital getting stuck in
trade receivables and loss making manufacturing activity of
the pharmaceutical unit. The Group has initiated legal
recourse against the defaulting customers and is regularly

on strategic initiatives for cost rationalization, optimum
product mix and efficient plant operations, the management
Our audit procedures were focused on obtaining sufficient
appropriate audit evidence that the going concern
assessment made by the Group is not materially misstated.
These procedures included, but were not limited to, the
following:
We analysed management’s report to gain an
understanding of the inputs and process underpinning the
cash flow model prepared for the purpose of the going
concern assessment.
We reviewed the operating performances of the various
units of the Group to evaluate whether or not they are
actually generating positive EBIDTA.
We assessed the possible mitigating actions identified by
management in the event that actual cash flows are below
forecast.

believes that accumulated losses would reasonably be
paired, in due course. The consolidated financial statements,
as such have been prepared on a going concern basis”.
The availability of sufficient funding and the testing of whether
the company will be able to continue meeting its obligations
under the financing covenants are important for the going
concern assumption and, as such, are significant aspects of
our audit. This test or assessment is largely based on the
expectations of and the estimates made by management.
The expectations and estimates can be influenced by
subjective elements such as estimated future cash flows,
forecasted results and margins from operations. Estimates
are based on assumptions, including expectations regarding
future developments in the economy and the market.
Information other than the Consolidated Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report thereon
The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the
information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s
report thereon.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any
form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements
or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we
are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Management’s Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements
The Holding Company’s Board of Directors are responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Companies Act,
2013 (“the Act”) with respect to the preparation of these consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view of
the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated
changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group in accordance with the accounting principles generally
accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) prescribed under section 133 of the Act. The
Holding Company’s Board of Directors is also responsible for ensuring accuracy of records including financial information
considered necessary for the preparation of consolidated Ind AS financial statements. Further, in terms of the provisions
of the Act, the respective Board of Directors /management of the companies included in the Group covered under the Act
are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding
the assets and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting
policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance
of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the
accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view
and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. These financial statements have been used for the
purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the
Group are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to
liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the Companies included in
the Group.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on
whether the Group has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of such
controls.
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
disclosures made by management.
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant
doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or,
if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained
up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue
as a going concern.
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a
manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of
the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our
audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements
regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be
thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most
significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit
matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the
matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report
because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected tooutweigh the public interest benefits of
such communication.
Other Matter
Financial Statements of Alchemist Healthcare Limited, subsidiary and Alchemist Medisphere Limited, associate, have not
been audited by us. They have been audited by other auditors whose reports have been furnished to us by the Management
and our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in
respect of the subsidiary and associate and our report in terms of subsections (3) of Section 143 of the Act, in so far as it
relates to the aforesaid subsidiary and associate, is based solely on the reports of the other auditors.
Our opinion is not qualified in respect of this matter as stated in the Other Matter paragraph.

ANNEXURE – A TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act,
2013 (“the Act”)
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of Alchemist Limited (“the Holding Company”), its
subsidiaries and its associates (together referred to as “the Group”) as of and for the year ended 31st March 2019, we have
audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of the Holding Company, its subsidiary companies and
associate, which are incorporated in India, as of that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The respective Board of Directors of the Holding Company, its subsidiary companies and associates, incorporated in
India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal controls over
financial reporting criteria established by the Holding Company, its subsidiary companies and associates, incorporated in
India, considering the essential components of internal controls stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial
Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). These responsibilities
include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively
for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company’s policies,
the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the
accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Holding Company’s, its subsidiary companies and associates, incorporated
in India, internal financial controls over financial reporting based on our audit conducted in accordance with the Guidance
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing,
issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable
to an audit of internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of Internal Financial Controls and, both issued by the
ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting was
established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls
system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that
a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion
on the Holding Company’s, its subsidiary companies and associate, incorporated in India, internal financial controls
system over financial reporting.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion
or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to
the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
PHARMA & CHEMICALS
Indian Pharmaceutical Industry: An overview
Current Market Trends and Scope
The Indian pharma industry has been growing at a Compounded Annual Growth rate (CAGR) of more than 15% over the last five years and
has significant growth opportunities. The growth driven factors in the domestic market are high burden of disease, good economic growth
leading to higher disposable incomes, improvements in healthcare infrastructure and improved healthcare financing, the report of PwC – CII
titled “India Pharma Inc.: Gearing up for the next level of growth”.
THE ROAD AHEAD: INDIAN PHARMA
Spending on healthcare is expected to increase in India at 9-12 per cent CAGR between 2018-22 to US$ 26-30 billion, driven by increasing
consumer spending, rapid urbanization, and raising healthcare insurance among others. Speedy introduction of generic drugs into the
market has remained in focus and is expected to benefit the Indian pharmaceutical companies.

The rampant spread of COVID-19 outbreak, across borders and geographies, has severely impacted almost the whole world and triggered
significant downside risks to the overall global economic outlook and India is no exception. Due to the lockdown announced by the

Government of India from 25th March, 2020, entire operations of the Company came to a halt. The lockdowns and restrictions imposed on
various activities due to the pandemic have posed challenges to the businesses of your Company.
The moratorium on debts and interest payments have been a source of support in otherwise severely impacted liquidity and operating cash
flows. The Board believes that it is difficult to predict any industry wide scenario for the immediate short term and the Company expects
to resume normal operations soon after lifting of lockdown. Although there are uncertainties due to the pandemic, the Company is taking
several measures to mitigate the adverse impact by optimizing costs and continuously realigning the cost and operating structures so as to
sustain viable level.
Quit Anemia, Quit Calcium Deficiency and Quit Weak Immunity:  Alchemist Pharma Initiative
After Independence, India has traversed many miles of success in diverse fields but healthcare continues to be a struggling point for
Independent India and is a stigma on one of the fastest growing economies of world. Government measures have been done but have not
been able to reach the masses. The only healthcare camp established by the Govt. of India was“PULSE POLIO”which took almost 4 decades
to make India a polio free country. As a result of the absence of such measures, India and Indian Population continues to suffer from iron
deficiency, calcium deficiency and weaken immunity. Moreover, weak immune system leads to Swine flu, Dengue, RTI, Cough and Cold that
are taking its toll on Indian masses. Alchemist as a socially responsible corporate has decided to work till we make India free of these three
cardinal elements afflicting Indian Society.Alchemist too believes that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step and initiated its
most popular programme Quit India movement for ANEMIA, CALCIUM DEFICIENCY and WEAK IMMUNITY through a nationwide campaign
from July which will continue till we give India freedom from these ailments. This nationwide programme is of importance as Alchemist has
pledged to support 50% therapy free of cost to selectively poor patients on first purchase and this medicine will directly go to the doctors
from where it will be distributed to patients.
Alchemist is represented through brands Anemi-XT for Iron Deficiency, Valcal-M for Calcium Deficiency and IGTG FORTE for Weak Immunity.
The scope of this campaign is huge as alone Govt. efforts will not be sufficient to see that India is free of these diseases.  This campaign
would endeavour Alchemist to achieve the wider aim in addition to Clean India campaign of Govt. of India by making Healthy India. So its
objectives are not only Clean India but ensuring a Healthy India. Alchemist effort is a NATION WIDE MOVEMENT OF IMPORTANCE.

AGRI BUSINESS
Domestic Market
Floriculture in India is being viewed as a high growth Industry. Indian Floriculture Market is growing at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate
(CAGR) of about 25%. A strong increase in the demand for cut and loose flowers has made floriculture as one of the important commercial
trades in Indian agriculture. According to report, “ Indian Agriculture Market Report & Forecast: (2018-2025) “, the demand for flowers
is increasing robustly in India. While exports remain a key motivator for cultivators, the domestic demand for flowers is also increasing
exponentially, especially in the metros and larger cities. Modernization and growing western cultural influences has driven consumers to
buy flowers on a number of occasions like valentine’s day, marriages, anniversaries, birthdays, friendship day, mother’s day, etc. Not only
occasion’s flowers/bouquets keep in demand throughout the year.
International Market
India is the second largest producer of flowers after China. Commercial floriculture is becoming important from the export angle. The
liberalization of industrial and trade policies have further paved the way for development of export-oriented production of cut flowers.
It has been found that commercial floriculture has higher potential per unit area than most of the field crops and is therefore a lucrative
business. The liberalized economy has given an impetus to the Indian entrepreneurs for establishing export oriented floriculture units under
controlled climatic conditions.
STEEL BUSINESS
Size of the Steel Wire Industry in India is 2.6 million tonne approximately in terms of volume & USD 1.7 billion in terms of value, combining
both organized and unorganized sectors. Approximately, 70% of total production comes from organized producers and the rest from the
unorganized counterpart. Wire Industry is accountable for approximately 5% of total demand of steel in India. India constitutes approximately
1% of the global wire exports and approximately 3% of Indian production caters a portion of the global markets.
Steel wire is used to make barbed wire, razor wire, wire mesh, chain link fencing for Poultry and other wire fencing for nonresidential and
residential building applications. The value is projected to increase at an annualized rate of 8.2%, fueling higher demand for wire fencing.
According to a market reports published by Transparency Market Research, “Fencing Market - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth,
Trends and Forecast, 2018-2022,” due to the slowdown in world economic growth, the Fencing industry has suffered a certain impact, but
still maintained a relatively optimistic growth. The metal fencing market is in a commanding position owing to a wide range of products
available under this category. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.5% between 2017 and 2025.
The global fencing market is largely driven by factors such as the rising consumer interest in home improvement and home décor and the
need for security and safety. Expanding residential construction and growing economies across the globe are also supporting the growth of
the fencing market. The increasing demand for residential fences and the growing acceptance and popularity of synthetic alternatives will
serve as an opportunity for the fencing industry. The global fencing market is affected by the fluctuating raw material prices and the rising
energy cost.
The fencing market is segmented into two major categories based on product type into agricultural wire fence and commercial wire fence.
Based on material type, the market is divided into four segments, namely metal, wood, plastic & composite and concrete fencing. The end
use segments covered in this report are residential, agricultural and the industrial sector. The market is further segmented by geography
into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Rest of the World regions.

Management Discussion And Analysis
With manufacturing facilities primarily in India, Alok Industries
is an integrated textiles manufacturer that is developing global
scales and servicing marquee customers across the world.
Today, the business is highly integrated with global markets
and macro-economic developments across the world have a
significant impact on its performance.
Economic Overview
World
Global growth remains moderate, with uneven prospects
across the main countries and regions. IMF estimates suggest
that global growth was a modest 3.4%in Calendar Year (CY)
2014, reflecting a pickup in growth in advanced economies
relative to the previous year and a slowdown in emerging
market and developing economies. Despite the slowdown,
emerging market and developing economies still accounted
for three-fourths of global growth in 2014. Complex forces
that affected global activity in 2014 are still shaping the
outlook. These include medium- and long-term trends, such
as population aging and declining potential growth; global
shocks, such as lower oil prices; and many country- or region-
specific factors, such as crisis legacies and exchange rate
swings triggered by actual and expected changes in monetary
policies.
Relative to CY 2014, the outlook for advanced economies is
improving in CY2015, while growth in emerging market and
developing economies is projected to be lower, primarily
reflecting weaker prospects for some large emerging market
economies and oil-exporting countries. Overall, global growth
is projected to be 3.5% in CY2015 (see Chart A).
Note: P is Projections; Source: International Monetary Fund (IMF)
Growth in the United States was stronger than expected,
averaging about 4% annualized in the last three quarters
of CY2014. Consumption—the main engine of growth—
has benefited from steady job creation and income growth,
lower oil prices, and improved consumer confidence. The
unemployment rate declined to 5.5% in February, more
than 1% point below its level of a year ago. In Japan, after
a weak second half of the year, growth in CY2014 was
close to zero, reflecting weak consumption and plummeting
residential investment. In the euro area, activity was weaker
than expected in the middle part of CY2014 but showed
signs of a pickup in the fourth quarter and in early 2015, with
consumption supported by lower oil prices and higher net
exports. Investment growth in China declined in the second
half of CY2014, reflecting a correction in the real estate
sector, and high-frequency indicators point to some further
slowdown. Growth in Latin America in the second half of
CY2014 was modest, reflecting weak activity in Brazil, lower
than-expected growth in Mexico, and weakening momentum
in other economies in the region. Economic performance
in Russia was a bit stronger than expected in the second
half of CY2014, but the increase in geopolitical tensions,
declining confidence, and the repercussions of the oil price
decline point to a more severe weakening of the outlook in
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) as a whole for
With the advanced economies regaining steam, its imports
have increased (see chart B). Unlike in the recent past, in
CY2014 the growth in imports of advanced economies did not
translate into higher growth in exports of emerging economies.
This indicates the fact that trade within advanced economies
have increased and helped enhance their domestic capacity
utilisations. Thus, competitive strength continued to intensify
for exports from emerging economies.
Note: P is Projections; Source: International Monetary Fund (IMF)
Importantly, there has been a complete churn in the global oil
and gas economy. This warrants a more detailed explanation.
The bottom line is that since November 2014 when oil
prices were at levels above US$100 a barrel, it fell sharply
to levels around US$ 40 a barrel in March 2015 and is today
trading around US$60 a barrel (see chart C). To explain the
reasons behind this, one needs to appreciate that oil prices
are determined by supply and demand conditions as well as
speculative investments based on expectations.

Four things have affected the pricing dynamics. First, demand
is low because of weak economic activity, increased efficiency,
and a growing switch away from oil to other fuels. Second,
turmoil in Iraq and Libya—two big oil producers with nearly
4m barrels a day of combined production – has not affected
global output. The market is more sanguine about geopolitical
risk. Third, USA has become the world’s largest oil producer.
Though it does not export crude oil, it now imports much less,
creating a lot of spare supply. Finally, the Saudis and their Gulf
allies have decided not to sacrifice their own market share to
restore the price. They could curb production sharply, but the
main benefits would go to countries they have strong political
discord with such as Iran and Russia. Consequently, there
has been a sharp fall in prices. Such a steep fall has pushed
expectations down and negative sentiments have further
impeded speculative demand affecting prices adversely.

Headline inflation has declined in advanced economies,
reflecting the decline in oil prices, softer prices for other
commodities, and a weakening of demand in a number of
countries already experiencing below-target inflation, such
as the euro area and Japan. This decline in inflation, together
with changes in the growth outlook and announcements
by the Bank of Japan in October 2014 and the European
Central Bank (ECB) in January of larger-than-expected asset
purchase programs, has strengthened expectations of a
protracted divergence in monetary policy stances across the
main advanced economies, widening long-term interest rate
differentials. With regard to emerging markets, lower prices
for oil and other commodities (including food, which has a
larger weight in the consumer price index of emerging market
and developing economies) have generally contributed to
reductions in inflation, with the notable exception of countries
suffering sizable exchange rate depreciations, such as Russia.
In this setting, raising actual and potential output continues
to be a general policy priority. In many advanced economies,
accommodative monetary policy remains essential to support
economic activity and lift inflation expectations. There is
also a strong case for increasing infrastructure investment
in some economies, and for implementing structural reforms
to tackle legacies of the crisis and boost potential output. In
many emerging market economies, macroeconomic policy
space to support growth remains limited. But in some lower
oil prices will help reduce inflation and external vulnerabilities,
thereby reducing pressure on central banks to raise policy
interest rates. Structural reforms to raise productivity, with a
varied agenda across countries, are of the essence to sustain
potential output
India
While there have been positive signals with the new BJP led
government coming to power in 2014, the macroeconomic
recovery is still very gradual. Admittedly, there have been
moves in the right direction. However, the pace of recovery
on the ground has been slow. The new GDP estimates, as
yet not accepted by all concerned even within different
ministries of the central government, suggest that real Gross
Value Added (GVA) grew by 7.5% in 2014-15 versus 6.6%
in 2013-14 (see Chart E). However, the data also shows that
much of the improvement occurred because of significantly
higher coverage of the services sector, which recorded 10.6%
growth in 2014-15.
Note: There has been change in methodology with all data
post 2012-13 depicting GVA, while the period before was
GDP. Both are similar concepts but there are differences
in calculation methodology. As yet there is no long series
that transforms the old GDP data in line with the new GVA
methodology. So, the pre-2013-14 are not comparable with
the new estimates of the last two years.

To be sure, there have been positive signals of business
confidence such as significantly greater interest of foreign
institutional investors in the Indian equity market. Moreover,
there is a small uptick in real investments. For instance, growth
in gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), which had hit a low
of (-)0.3% in 2012-13 has improved to 4.1% in 2014-15.

However, it is only fair to say that while trends may be in the
right direction, India has not yet seen the kind of investments
needed in the real sectors of the economy to regain its earlier
high growth trajectory.
Despite the cautionary tone, it needs stating that there
were two positive trends in 2014-15. First, as touched upon
earlier, there has been renewed interest in India from foreign
investors. This has certainly reflected in terms of foreign
portfolio investments (FPI) in the stock market. For portfolio
investments, while in 2013-14 there was capital flight with a
US$487 million net outflow, in 2014-15 there has been a net
inflow of US$38.9 billion. Moreover, we are perhaps beginning
to see greater interest in foreign direct investments (FDI). For
the April-February period, where data is available, FDI into
India increased by 23% from US$26.5 billion in 2013-14 to
US$32.7 billion in 2014-15.
These financial inflows into the country have helped stabilise
the rupee, which witnessed a sharp fall in 2013. Since January
2015, even the gradual devaluation trend has stabilised and
foreign exchange fluctuations have become less apparent (see
chart F)
Chart F: Exchange Rate (Re / US$ 1)
Source: Pacific Exchange Rate
The other positive news is that inflation seems to be under
control. Measured in terms of the consumer price index
(CPI), inflation reduced to 5.2% in March 2015 from 5.4% in
February. It has been the lowest rate in three months thanks
to a reduction in food prices, and is significantly below the
average CPI inflation rate in India between 2012 and end-
2014, when it averaged 8.7%. While the Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) has signalled a gradual easing of interest rates with two
25 basis points cut in the benchmark repo rate— bringing
the level down from 8% in December 2014 to 7.5% in April
2015—more needs to be done. Indian industry, in general,
and the construction sector, in particular, is suffering from
high interest costs. In the absence of any near-term worries
about an overheated economy and given a benign inflation
environment, many believe that it is time for the RBI and the
commercial banks to further cut interest rates and stimulate
much needed growth in the real economy.
So, while there are some positive signals for the India’s
economic growth, there are clear concerns that we are far
from being on the runway for a take-off.
Textiles, Clothing and Fibre Industry
Global Scenario
In this economic backdrop, there were mixed signals from
the global textile industry during 2013 and 2014. While the
overall steady growth trend is apparent, there are also several
structural changes taking place. To throw some light on this,
let us look at the numbers.
The global apparel market, which is the primary end-user
segment for the entire textiles value chain, was around US$
1,146 Bn in 2013 and is estimated around US$ 1,200 Bn
in 2014. This overall market is growing at 5% CAGR and is
estimated to reach US$ 2,110 by 2025. This growth in market
size in value terms can be attributed to growing population,
increasing per capita consumption globally.
The apparel industry constitutes ~1.8% of the World GDP.
EU27, US, China and Japan together constitute almost 75% of
the total market. China is expected to be the biggest consumer
of apparel in 2025 with a market size of US$ 540 Bn. Table 1

Per capita consumption of apparel in India was US$37 in
2013 and around US$40 in 2014. This is the lowest per capita
consumption among all the major countries and is expected to
increase with the improvement in overall economy in India. To
put these figures in context, per capita consumption of apparel
in 2013 in other regions is Global Average – 163, China – 122,
USA – 725, Japan - 885 and Australia – 1131

Given that consumption centres for apparel are in different
regions compared to production centres, there is a flourishing
world trade that supports the global apparel industry. In fact,
world trade in textile and apparel grew in 2014 and is estimated
to be US$821 Bn. The overall trade is expected to grow at a
CAGR of 6.6% up to 2020 and reach US$1,180 by the end of
this decade.

US Imports: After a slight drop in 2012, US apparel and textile
imports have been growing steadily every year. In calendar
year (CY) 2014 the total US textile and apparel imports grew
by 2.6% over the previous year. The domestic US market for
textiles and Apparel was healthy during 2014. Domestic mill
production grew around 3.5% in 2014, which was higher than
import growth. There has been a trend towards promoting
domestic production and import growth has been affected.
The market demand is expected to continue growing steadily
in 2015, but there will be greater impediments to imports
some easing out of cost arbitrage opportunities with domestic
players improving operational cost. So while opportunity
for exports to USA persists, competition continues to get
cut throat not only amongst exporting countries but from a
stronger domestic production base.

Source: OTEXA
Table 3 illustrates that even though China is the largest
import partner for US, due to a variety of reasons including
increased domestic costs, the exchange rate appreciation
of the Yuan compared to the dollar, and environment related
cost increments, China’s import growth to USA has reduced in
2014. In fact, Vietnam and India are growing much faster. They
are also looking to diversify from Bangladesh in recent times
due to social compliance issues. Hence, going forward the
opportunity for India and Vietnam should increase to further
penetrate US markets.

Category wise break up of India’s export in textile and apparel
shows that overall exports has increased by 13% in last 2
years. Overall Exports in 2014-15 are almost same as previous
year mainly due to decreasing trend of cotton fiber exports
out of India. Apparel exports in 2014-15 have increased by
11% over 2013-14 and by 29% over 2012-13. This is mainly
due to increased focus on value added exports and change
in exchange rates. Made up exports have grown by 15% in
last 2 years. Fabric exports have also increased by 50% over
last 2 years and this is mainly due to increased exports of
fabric to countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam for converting
into apparel. As can be observed there is a good demand
for finished products and the Company is also focussing on
exports of value added items.

lot over last 1 year the market size at current exchange rate of

grown in 2014 by around 10. Increasing demand for apparels
is due to increase in per capita consumption, rising disposable

phone growth in smaller cities, growth of organized retail and
e-commerce etc.
Outlook
The Indian textile industry has the potential to double itself
in size over the next 6-7 years. Among the major competing
nations, China is losing its competitive advantage in textile
mainly on account of increasing labor costs, appreciating
Yuan, rising power costs, focus on domestic market and
also due to conscious strategy to move towards higher value
additions industries.
Other major exporting countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh
are facing geo-political issues. In this scenario all major
export markets like USA, Europe, Japan and Australia are
increasingly looking to shift a large portion of their sourcing
pie. India is well placed to fill this gap since its entire major
costs like cotton, yarn, power, wages, dyes and chemicals are
today globally competitive. In addition, the government also
has been supportive for the industry and in order to unlock the
complete potential of India, more efforts are needed from the
industry as well as the government.
A ‘Make in India’ campaign covering 25 sectors, including the
textile and garment industry, has been unveiled by the Prime
Minister in the presence of big names from the corporate world
of India and abroad at a ceremony in New Delhi.
The ‘Make in India’ scheme also puts in place the logistics
and systems to address in a timely manner queries of potential
investors. At present, the Government of India allows 100%
foreign direct investment (FDI) under the automatic route in
the textile sector, subject to all applicable regulations and
laws, which effectively backs the make in India program for
the textile and garment industry.
Under the ‘Make in India’ initiative, investment opportunities
for foreign companies and entrepreneurs are available across
the entire value chain of synthetics, value-added and specialty
fabrics, fabric processing set-ups for all kinds of natural and
synthetic textiles, technical textiles, garments, and retail
brands.
Technology Up-gradation Fund Scheme (TUFS): This
scheme, which was launched by the Ministry of Textiles on
April 1, 1999 has given major thrust for the sector. SIDBI is
the nodal agency for the SSI in the textile and cotton ginning
and pressing sector. This Scheme aims at making available
funds at competitive rates to the domestic textile industry for
technology up-gradation of existing units as well as to set up
new units with state-of-the-art technology so that its viability
and competitiveness in the domestic as well as international
markets may enhance.
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs late in August
2014 gave its approval for continuing the TUFS during the 12th
Plan period with a major focus on power looms in accordance
with the Budget announcement for the financial year 2013-14.
The total budget outlay for continuation of the scheme will be
about ` 11,900 crore, out of which ` 2,400 crore was allocated
for 2013-14. The scheme is one of the flagship schemes of
the Ministry of Textiles and has helped the industry to garner
investments of ` 2,430 crore. The scheme is expected to
generate 11.5 % annual growth in volume terms in cloth
production and 15% in value exports by increasing domestic
value addition and technological depth and by enhancing
the global competitiveness of textile products to generate an
additional employment to 15.81 million workers.
Concerns of the sector:
The sector continues to face certain concerns, which need to
be ironed out by companies in the industry and the government
working in tandem. Some of the issues are highlighted below.
Preferential tax regime: The textile sector has not got its due
under the new Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) despite it being one
of the largest employment providers in country. According to
cotton textiles export promotion council or (TEXPROCIL) the
industry faces the challenges of high tariffs barriers on account
of preferential tariff arrangements. Duty sops of 2% only were
granted to the mainstream cotton textile products, while higher
rates were given for handlooms, carpets, coir products under
the merchandise exports from India scheme (MEIS).
Further, man-made textile industry which is highly capital
intensive and the only sector capable of attracting FDI has
been discriminated against vis-à-vis the cotton industry. The
sector which can help the government achieve its ambitious
target has not been mentioned in the list of items granted
liberal MEI’S benefits under the FTP announced on the first
of April.
MMF textiles that contributes ` 7000 crore as taxes and holds
high potential has been given lower reward in the FTP’s new
scheme. For Europe and the US, MMF products have been
given lower incentives as compared to cotton textiles.
Further, the benefits for promoting exports to major emerging
markets for MMF textiles such as Latin America, Far East
and African countries have been completely stopped in the
new FTP without giving the sector’s exporters any scope for
adjustment.
Import of second hand machinery: Import of second-hand
textile machineries is hitting the local textile industry. Many
old machines are imported, into the country, which are more
than 10 years old, particularly in the weaving segment. With
the global textile industry moving out of the Western world,
mills are looking to dump machinery into markets like India.
Rigid and dated labour laws: The current labour laws have been
a major reason behind the inability of the sector to expand
and acquire global scale. This is specifically valid for ‘cut and
sew’ operations, where the labour involvement is maximum
compared to other steps of the manufacturing value chain.
Hence, in order to attract large-scale investments, acquire
global scale and bring the Indian sector at par with other

Statutory Section

competing countries, there is an immediate need to review the
labour laws to make them investor and labour friendly. Ideally
the 44 labour laws, most of which were drafted in the earlier
part of the last century, need to be repealed and replaced
by one, or at best a few, user-friendly law(s) suited to the
conditions of the 21st century.
Lack of economies of scale: Lack of economies of scale is
a major issue in Indian textile and apparel manufacturing
sector. Countries like China and Bangladesh have developed
large production set-ups, whereas smaller units, which lack
economies of scale and have a low level of technology,
dominate the Indian textile sector. Due to lack of large
manufacturing capacities Indian manufacturers are unable to
cater to large orders and become globally competitive.
Business Strategy
Alok Industries (‘Alok’ or ‘the Company’) is primarily an
integrated business operation with a presence across the entire
value chain of cotton and polyester. The business continues to
leverage opportunities to optimise financial returns but gaining
from its integrated operations and presence across the value
chain. In addition, the Company has expanded its markets
with a customer base that spans across global territories. This
integrated diversified model provides the opportunity to adjust
production and sales across product segments according to
independent market fluctuations.
Essentially, business growth is driven by the following levers:
Preferred Vendor status with leading Global Brands &
Retailers and established relationships
Critical supplier for buyers due to Quality, Cost &
Delivery (QCD)
Economies of scale provides competitive advantage
Forward and backward Integration leading to sustained
margins
Wide range of products across different market
segments
In-house product development and designing strength
State-of-the-art manufacturing facilities with world class
infrastructure viz., captive power plants, reverse osmosis
ETP, housing colonies, fire brigades, training centers, etc.
Apart from the diversification in product and markets, there
are two essential characteristics of the Company’s business
model – focus on value added products and reaping benefits
of creating global scale of operations, which are essential to
compete in the global market place and leverage opportunities
to create long term value.
Creating the manufacturing and operations facilities of
such scale and product diversity has entailed large scale
investments, much of which has been financed by debt. In
addition, economic conditions in the last few years have been
such that the regular operations have also warranted exposure
to credit terms and requirements of working capital in line with
the scale of operations.
Consequently, while the Company has created and developed
the requisite foundation to leverage global market opportunities
and embark on an accelerated growth path, Alok is today,
having to deal with a financially leveraged balance sheet. This
is a natural phase of such investment led growth objectives.
There is always a time lag between creating infrastructure and
generating sufficient returns from the investments incurred.
Today, Alok Industries is in this phase and there are certain
important strategic decisions that have to be implemented in
this interim period.
The focus is on reaping maximum benefits from existing assets
and developing capital structures that minimise finance costs.
Therefore, the Company is now implementing a management
system that continuously stresses on maximising Return on
Capital Employed (ROCE) across different layers and sectors
of the Company’s business operations. In addition, there are
active efforts at reducing the cost of debt and deleveraging the
balance sheet. On a specific note, there is a concerted effort
at developing innovative financial structures to dollarize its
debt and secure low cost international finance that is hedged
against currency fluctuations by the Company’s growing
exports.
In a bid to further diversify the business risks and leverage
market opportunities, the Company had also invested into
certain new initiatives that were in addition to its core textiles
manufacturing operations out of India.
This included acquisition of Mileta, a Czech Republic based
integrated textiles player; UK based retail venture called ‘Store
Twenty One’ through its associate Grabal Alok (UK) Limited;
Indian retail operations through “H&A” Stores; and real estate
investments. Across all these businesses, the focus is on
enhancing value and exploring opportunities to strategically
monetise the assets to deleverage the balance sheet.
The Company has already initiated steps to exit from its non-
core businesses. In this context, the Company has already
closed its domestic retail (H & A) business by shutting down
the stores set up across India. It has also got traction in selling
material portions of its commercial real estate units, which
were located in Mumbai.
The Company is continuing its efforts to sell majority of it non-
core assets in the next financial year and use the proceeds to
reduce debt.
EPBG Backed Long Term Export Advance
Given the liquidity crunch and the high costs of servicing
debt, the Company has been focusing on undertaking several
initiatives for financial restructuring of business transactions.
During the current financial year, in line with this objective, the
Company has worked on securing Export Performance Bank
Guarantee (EPBG) based long term export advance.
The Reserve Bank of India has allowed exporters to raise long
term export advance for a maximum period of 10 years vide
their Notification RBI/2013-14/597 A.P. (DIR Series) Circular
Under the said circular SBI as Authorised Dealer has approved
and assessed EPBG facility of USD 1.63 bn which will be
serviced through exports over a period of 10 years. The banks
have been supportive of the Company’s efforts at improving

28th Annual Report | 1st October, 2013 to 31st March, 2015
liquidity and reducing cost of debt. So, under this scheme, the
banks are setting up an EPBG Limit of USD 1.63 bn for a period
of 10 years to facilitate exports by Alok. The export advances
so received is being used for repayment of funded facility of
respective banks as per the provisions of the aforesaid RBI
notification.
The Commitment under the EPBG Facility and the Export
Advance Facility shall reduce over the 10-year period as per a
pre-agreed reduction schedule .
The proposed facility would help Alok address the following:
Improve the competitiveness of the company in the
global market by reducing its financial cost (expected
annual saving in the initial year of about USD 100 mn)
Repayment obligations would get rationalised as per
the Company’s cash flows, thereby reducing the stress
of cash flow mismatches and ensure gradual reduction
in debt of the Company, making the Company financially
sound
Till date, the Company has received sanctions of EPBG of about
USD 1.5 Billion and has received export advances amounting
to USD 475 Million. The Company expects to complete the
entire EPBG scheme by August / September 2015

Extension of Financial Year
The Company’s current financial year was also extended over
18 months from 1 October 2013 to 31 March 2015. For all
analysis and related data in this management and discussion
section current year refers to the 18 month period ended
31 March 2015, while the previous year refers to 18 months
ended 30 September 2013.
While last year ended 30 September 2013, the 18 month
extension of the financial year was due to a need to give to
the effect of High court order for merger of few domestic
subsidiaries into one subsidiary, namely Alok Infrastructure
Limited, the current year ended 31 March 2015 extension of 18
months was due to mandatory provision of New Companies
Act, for closing the financial year in March. The Company has
received the requisite approval of the Registrar of Companies
for the same.
While there are some seasonal differences, the two periods
are comparable as they both include 6 quarter performances.

Textiles Business: Operations Review
Overview
The key to Alok’s textiles operations is the integrated business
model that has a presence across the entire value chain for
both cotton and polyester fibre products. This allows for
diversity in product lines and market segments. In addition,
there is continuous focus on value added products like
technical textiles.
Chart O gives the relative share of the different product groups
in the Company’s total stand alone sales. It is evident that given
market conditions, the focus has been on selling products that
are on the higher end of the value chain. The share of woven
fabric has increased from 58% in the previous year to 75%
in the current year. The shares of both polyester and home
textiles, including sheeting and terry towels, have reduced –
polyester from 24% in the previous year to 11% in the current
year and home textiles from 13% in the previous year to 10%
in the current year. The other product groups have limited
sales and their shares in total sales have remained stable.
Alok’s Sales distributed by product groups is given in table 8
Debt to Equity for long term loans decreased from 1.61
in the previous year to 1.22 in the current year. Total debt
to equity ratio reduced from 2.98 in the previous year to
2.72 in the current year
Operating EBIDTA/Interest indicates the Company’s
ability to service its debt costs through profits. Operating
EBIDTA/Interest decreased from 2.27 in the previous year
to 1.62 in the current year
Current ratio was 1.58 in the current year compared to
1.49 in the previous year
Inventory turnover increased from 158 days in the
previous year to 205 days in the present year. Debtor

Exports
While global trade in textiles and apparel is steadily growing,
competition has become severe and demand was affected
in advanced economies especially in Europe. Alok continued
to maintain strong relations with global brands and developed
the exports market maintaining a fine balance between growth,
margins and domestic opportunities. Consequently, export
sales reduced by 24.41% to ` 3,861.60 crore in the current year.
However, with a share in total sales of 17.45%, exports remains
important for Alok’s overall business strategy. In fact, going
forward there will be renewed emphasis to grow exports.
Chart P plots the share of different regions in which Alok’s
exports continued to perform well but given market dynamic
its share in Alok’s total sales reduced to 26% in 2012-13.
USA remains the dominant market with 45% share in the
current year, up from 42% in the previous year. The share of
Asia has increased from 23% in the previous year to 33% in

Cotton and Cotton Yarn
Alok has strong long term relationships and experience
in sourcing and selling raw cotton. In the initial phase, the
Company expanded its weaving and knitting facilities, and
followed it up with backward integration into spinning to
produce yarn. Today, based on market conditions, Alok
flexibly decides on which products in the value chain to sell
in the external market and which to use internally for further
processing.

For Alok, since major portion of consumption of cotton yarn is captive, external sales remains low, accounting for only 1.51% of
the total sales of the company for the 18 months period ended 31 March 2018. The external sales are mostly opportunity based
and hence may vary from year to year.
Overview of Cotton Spinning Division
• Alok has the largest spinning facility in India at a single location (Silvassa); with capacity off 411,840 ring spindles (60,000
tons) and 5,680 open end rotors (20,000 tons) to support in-house apparel fabric and home textiles segments
• 85%-90% of the cotton yarn manufactured is utilized for captive consumption by the apparel fabric (woven & knit fabrics)
and home textile (Bed Sheets & Towels) divisions
• External Sales by cotton spinning business constituted about 1.51% of total revenue of the company for the 18 months
period ended September 30, 2013
• Procurement of raw cotton at right price and during harvest remains crucial. Looking at the volatility in the prices of cotton
in the recent past, the company tries to maintain an inventory holding to the extent of 3-4 months requirement matching
its average sales order book which is also 3-4 months for apparel fabrics, home textiles and garments. Thus, it
has in-built risk mitigation for cotton price fluctuation. Further, due to its integrated operations cotton constitutes
about 27% – 28% of its fabric selling price and thus has limited impact on the overall operations
During the current year, given a softening of raw material
prices, Alok strategically reduced external cotton sales and
focused on further internal processing to sell products higher
up the value chain. The size of raw cotton and yarn operations
is much larger than what the external sales capture as a large
portion is processed further ahead in the value chain.
In terms of external sales there was 21.2% growth in the
domestic market in the current year when compared to the
previous year. Export growth was even higher at 37.3%.
However, in terms of volumes the absolute sales were low
compared to the total revenues of the Company.

Cotton and Yarn – Key Dynamics
Product mix
Compact yarn, dyed yarn, blended yarn
Target segment
Primarily captive consumption by fabric and home textiles division (85% to 90%)
10% to 15% of cotton yarn production is sold to traders, distributors and manufacturing units in the
domestic as well as export markets
Highlights
Largest spinning capacity at a single location in India (at Silvassa)
Industry Scenario
Cotton prices have steadily reduced over the course of the current year. While during October 2013,
the price of Shankar 6 variety was around ` 45,000 per candy, by March 2015, it has reduced to levels
of around ` 35,000 per candy and prices are expected to stay stable or on the lower side
Due to decline in global cotton production and steady increase in consumption, the cotton consumption
is expected to exceed production in CY 2015/16 for the first time in last five years. Though this will
result in a decline in the global cotton stock levels, given the carry-over stocks, the same will continue
to remain at elevated levels of ~136.8 million bales which will be equivalent to stock to consumption
ratio of ~92% as compared to ~99% which is expected at the end of CY 2014/15
The global cotton production is expected to decline by ~5.2% while the cotton consumption is
expected to increase by ~4.5% in CY 2015/16, driven by low cotton prices. The cotton production
is expected to decline across all the major cotton producing countries led by China and USA due to
decline in acreage as farmers shift to alternate crops. The increase in cotton consumption is expected
to be driven, mainly by China, on account of decline in the cotton prices which has improved the
competitiveness of cotton with respect to synthetic fibers, improving growth prospects for some of
the developed countries which are also the largest consumer of textile products and lagged effect of
low cotton prices in CY 2014/15
India will consolidate its position as the world’s largest cotton producer in CY 2015/16 due to relatively
lower dec line in the cotton production as compared to that in China, which was the world’s largest
cotton producer till CY 2013/14 (source: ICRA Research)

• Cotton trading and yarn operations of the company are opportunistic; primarily to benefit from
the market conditions
Due to captive consumption and a small component of external sales, competition from other spinning
mills and cotton traders is not applicable to the company
Current Capacity
60,000 tons ring spun yarn
20,000 tons open-ended yarn
Apparel Fabric
Fabric is at the core of Alok’s business. Its competitive strength
is derived from the wide range of products both woven
and knitted. In the woven space the product range extends
from 20 counts to 120 counts, in various finishes, Yarn dyed
shirting /Dyed / Printed, while in knitted, too, there are several
types of qualities like single jersey / double jersey / jacquard/
dobby/ yarn dyed etc. Alok continued to make the most of
the opportunities in India and abroad for fabrics. However,
for both woven and knitted fabrics exports were lower in the
current year compared to the previous year. In the domestic
market there was good growth in woven fabrics but for knitted
fabrics sales were down.

Overview of Apparel Fabric Division
Alok has one of the largest woven and knitted fabrics capacities in the country – 186 million meters p.a. for woven fabrics
and 25000 tons p.a. for knitted fabrics. It also outsources bulk of its fabric requirement.
Key business segment for the company contributing 76.5% of total revenue for the 18 months period ended September 30,
2013 with revenue of ` 16,939.68 crore
Integrated operations, large scale, state of the art weaving , knitting & processing, in-house designing & product development
team, wide range of products, differentiates the company in this segment
The company manufactures finished fabric primarily against orders which helps mitigate the risk of unsold inventory, while
the pricing takes into account prevailing market price of raw material and foreign currency rate for exports
Strong backward integration by way of in-house cotton and blended yarn production helps minimize the impact of any
adverse fluctuations in yarn prices
The apparel fabric division has a highly diversified and reputed customer base which includes garment exporters, garment
brands, wholesalers, traders and retailers in domestic market, garment companies in international market and institutional
sales to armed forces, government companies and corporates for work wear and technical textiles both in domestic and
international markets
Company has identified technical textile products and high-end yarn dyed fabric as its major growth areas
In the apparel fabric market, Alok is focusing particularly on
three segments to achieve growth –
fashion wear, yarn dyed fabrics and work-wear & technical
textiles.
Fashion-wear: Alok has a wide range both in knits and
wovens. There is a wide variety of fabric types include twills,
voiles, cambrics, poplins, Lycra poplins gabardines, jacquard,
satins, matte, canvases, butta dobby, lawn, yarn dyed and
many more. The products are distributed through different
channels each of which is specific to a certain customer
group. The Company also sells directly to certain customers.
The end customers include Indian exporters, converters in
international countries, domestic garment manufacturers,
retailers and traders, and institutions.
Yarn-Dyed Fabric: This is a sub-segment within fashion-
wear, which includes fabric used for fashionable shirting and
high end women’s wear. The products are of high quality and
command premium prices in the market.
Technical Textiles: These are speciality fabrics that have
special functionality and are used in industrial, aerospace,
military, marine, medical, construction, transportation and
high technology applications. Some examples of these fabrics
are fire retardant fabric, water repellent and soil release fabric
and high visibility fabric. These products offer high margins
on account of their specialised characteristics. The technical
textiles market in India is still in infancy and fairly unorganised.
It is also highly import intensive. The Indian technical textiles
market, which is estimated to be US$12.4 billion in 2013 is
expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.4% to reach US$23 billion
by 2020.

It has emerged amongst as the largest producers and exporters of bed linen in the country and has won several Gold
trophies from Texprocil, Ministry of Textiles, Government of India
With total sales of 2,264.50 crore for the 18 months period ended March 31, 2014, home textiles division accounts for
10.23% of overall revenues
Integrated operations with spinning / processing capabilities enables better control over product quality and yields better
margins
Presence in the relatively high end home textiles (300 to 800 counts) product category enable higher price realisation and
helps mitigate competition from other low cost manufacturing countries and domestic companies
In home textile segment, Alok is mainly present in the exports markets (99% exports) where it faces competition from
Chinese, Pakistani and Turkish manufacturers
Established and reputed multinational clientele results in strong customer profile; periodic pricing resets to protect margins
in case of increase in input costs / foreign exchange fluctuations
to register strong export growth. This bears testament to the
fact that there is consolidation in the global market where end
customers is focusing on a few reliable good quality suppliers.
And, the fact that Alok has built strong relationships with major
international customers.
Home textiles sales were lower in the current year for exports,
when compared to the previous year. And, export is the
primary segment. Domestic sales grew but the base level
of sales in the domestic market is still very low and for this
product group, exports is the primary market.
Within home textiles, terry towels sales grew in both domestic
(8.4%) and exports (11.8%), while for sheetings domestic sales
growth was 30.1%, where as exports reduced by (-18.2%)

Highlights
Largest domestic player in manufacturing and export of bed sheets (Received various export awards
from Government of India)
Amongst top four players in terry towels
Strong integration – in house spinning, weaving, processing and stitching unit enabling control over
end product quality and better margins
Industry Scenario
Global trade in Home Textiles segment is estimated at around US$ 32 billion, accounting for about
5% of the total global textile market
India with exports of USD 3 billion, currently is the largest supplier of terry towels and bed sheets
Spend on home textiles is price sensitive in nature with demand vulnerable to economic slowdowns;
demand shift to lower value segment within home textiles from time to time based on market conditions
India’s domestic consumption is presently low, however, offers great potential for growth
Peers
Welspun India, Trident, Indo Count Industries, GHCL, Bombay Dyeing, Hanung Toys & Textiles Ltd.,
etc. are some of the major Indian players in this segment
International competition is from manufacturers based out of China, Pakistan, Turkey, etc.
Current Capacity
Wider width fabrics – 150 million meters
Terry towels – 13,400 tons
Future plans
Company may grow the capacities of terry towels in a gradual manner
The major export market for home textile is USA, which is
the largest consuming centre for home products in the world.
The other export destinations include Europe and Australia.
The company would be looking at expanding its geographical
Garments
Alok’s products include knitted or woven garments for ladies,
gents and children, garments for sportswear, active wear,
casual wear and sleepwear, garments made from fabrics
like solid, mélange, yarn dyed, auto stripes, jacquards,
embroidered and variety of prints like transfer prints, and
block prints. While garment sales, especially for exports, show
encouraging growth potential, there is fierce cost competition.
Alok is therefore also looking at increasing capacities through
outsourcing, either directly or through its subsidiaries to
low cost operators, both in India and overseas, especially
Bangladesh, where quality garments can be produced at
competitive prices.
The Company is focusing on institutional sales for garment.
This includes product lines like work-wear and uniforms.
Garments sales were down for both the domestic as well as
exports markets. This is also a reflection of the Company’s
focus moving away from garments.
distribution of home textile division in future. The bed linen
segment with over 75% share in revenue of the home textile
division is the major contributor for the division.

Polyester Yarn
With the expansion of texturising capacity and to save on
the raw material cost, the Company has increased its total
production capacity of POY. This round of capacity increase
has been done through Continuous Polymerization (CP) route.
Under the CP route, POY is manufactured from PTA and MEG.
Polyester Staple Fibre (PSF) and Partially Oriented Yarn (POY)
demand is expected to grow due to rising consumption of
blended and non-cotton yarns. However, in the domestic
market, there has been a significant increase in capacity and
this has created intense competition.
Alok has consciously made investments on the value added
side of the business and is focusing on texturised yarn,
specialised yarns and fire retardant yarns. This positioning
at the higher end of the polyester value chain provides the
Company with necessary competitive edge. The focus is on
products like Dyed Texturised Yarns, Fully Drawn Yarn and
Cationic Yarn.

Statutory Section
Management Discussion and Analysis
Innovative Textile Solutions 71
There was large fall in domestic and export sales of polyester
during the current year, where there was severe market
competition and lack of demand growth. The sales reduction
was deliberately done due to the prevailing market dynamics.
There is a strong correlation between oil prices and polyester
prices as the principal inputs PTA and MEG are derivatives of
the petroleum refining process. Oil prices, as has been stated
before fell sharply especially in the second half of the current
year. Consequently, polyester prices also adjusted downwards.
In this market fluctuation, there were timing issues in buying
raw material and actually processing it to manufacture the end
product, Essentially, end product prices often reduced while
one held to higher cost raw material stock because there was
a natural production time lag. In the process, margins were
under pressure and mistiming markets resulted in losses. So,
the Company curtailed its market exposure instead of taking
on the highly volatile market risks.

Overview of Polyester Division
Although sales have fallen, Polyester Yarn division remain the second highest revenue generating segment for Alok after
Apparel Fabric division, with sales of ` 2,412.68 crore for the 18 months period ended March 31, 2015, which is 10.9% of
total company’s revenue
Demand scenario on long term basis is likely to be good due to increasing substitution of natural fibres
Competition from Chinese manufacturers, large Indian peers & unorganised domestic texturisers; however Alok’s large
scale integrated operations and focus on finished products make it a sustainable player
Relatively moderate EBDITA margins due to commodity nature of business; volatility in raw material (MEG & PTA) prices
may affect profitability margins if not passed through adequately
The integrated polyester business commands better ROCE as compared to integrated cotton business due to higher asset
turnover and lower working capital intensity

Industry Scenario
The market is undergoing a phase of correction. While the inherent long term growth trend exist, the
exuberance created by rising cotton prices and rapid substitution has abated due to stabilisation of
cotton prices
Sharp fall in oil prices have resulted in subdued polyester pricing creating a pressure on margins
There is also over-capacity in some market, especially in Asia that has had a dampening effect on
prices.

Quality, Safety, Health and Environment
At Alok, producing consistent world-class quality products
is not just a business pre-requisite – it is a way of life. The
Company recognises that in an era of changing demands
and global competition, creating customer delight will mean
producing world class fabrics – not just occasionally but
every time without fail. To ensure this, quality procedures
are paramount in Alok’s manufacturing process. And this
obsession with quality is recognised by internationally
accepted certifications for the Company’s work processes
and quality initiatives.
The Company’s management systems that ensure highest
standards of quality are also integrated with its commitment
to adopting best practices in health, safety and environment
as well its endeavour to be a socially responsible corporate
citizen.
During the year under review, Alok has continued its
certification for ISO 9001:2008 (for quality), ISO 14001:2004
(for environment friendly work practices), OHSAS 18001:2007
(for health and safety) as Integrated Management System
(IMS) and SA 8000 (Social Accountability). The IMS and SA
8000 is for Silvassa, Vapi and Pawane. Alok is amongst the
few textile companies to have obtained the four international
certificates i.e. QMS, EMS, OHSAS, SA 8000.
As part of its sustainability initiatives, the Company is deeply
committed to the manufacture of organic cotton products. This
has been recognised through three certificates that Alok got
during the year under review: the EU Flower (an eco-certificate
from the European Union); the KRAV certification for organic
products; and the SWAN – a Danish eco-labelling certificate.
Alok is perhaps the first Indian textile company to have been
awarded these three certificates for its eco-friendly products.
The SA 8000 is a globally recognised voluntary standard that
is used by employers to measure their own performance and
responsibly manage their supply chains. It is grounded on the
principles of core ILO conventions, UN conventions, and an
ISO-style management system.

Information Technology (IT)
Alok has always utilised IT as a business enabler to optimise
its processes and build a competitive edge. Implementation
of appropriate new technology and up-gradation of IT tools is
an on-going process at Alok. The Company had already made
significant investments and for much of the current financial
year, the focus was on consolidating the existing systems and
deriving returns for business functions.
Some highlights for the year include:
SAP application has stabilised very well and seamless through
the financial year. Technical and function team worked
continuously on enhancing the performance and consolidating
various SAP functions.
CO module has been tested for various business divisions and
unit testing results are found to be satisfactory. Final testing
of some divisions and integration testing are planned. Many
rounds of testing for various scenarios had to be carried out
as the cost run impacts product pricing and inventory. There
has also been a delay on account of unexpected resource turn
over.
HR team evaluated SAP cloud offering, “SuccessFactors”.
ESS and “SuccessFactors” may be evaluated further during
the coming year, subject to techno/commercial feasibility and
ROI analysis.
BI evaluation was deferred, as the focus was more on
consolidating and enhancing the already implemented
standard and customised functionalities. Present deployment
supports most of the BI requirements of management and we
may review and evaluate BI tools, depending on the needs of
business during the coming year.
Database replication using Oracle log shipping and vision
software are working seamlessly. Regular data backup and
above mentioned replication mechanisms ensure a very high
recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective
(RTO).
Business Continuity Planning (BCP) is another focus area.
There have been some challenges in keeping the Bangalore
DR server online due to various technical constraints including
stable connectivity. We are working closely with VISION
software, IBM and Sify to resolve this. As of now DR server
at Bangalore is about 2-3 hours behind production server.
Replication on DR server at Bangalore has been consistently
near online. With this, we have achieved 3 levels of data
security-regular back up on cartridges, online replication of
data at Vapi at database level and online replication of data at
Bangalore using “DoubleTake” application. This is working well
though constant monitoring is required to ensure consistency.
Datacentre is equipped with best class storage area network
configured at highest redundancy level to ensure maximum data
security. Adequate power backup with multiple UPS systems
configured in auto-failover mode provide uninterrupted power
supply for the infrastructure. Access to datacentre is controlled
through face reader devices. The Company has replaced the
old IBM SAN storage (IBM DS4300) with a new storage, as
DS4300 is declared to be out of support/life. The new storage
has been sized to have enough storage for another 5 years.
Communication
All the locations are connected through dedicated multiprotocol
label switching (MPLS) virtual private networks (VPNs). Key
locations have been provided with redundant links to ensure
100% uptime. In addition to Video Conferencing facility and
PRI links across all locations, application for real-time, unified
communications and collaboration has also been deployed for
effective communication.
Human Resource
One of the major reasons for the sustained success of
Alok Industries is our focus on the Management of Human
Resources. The top management is convinced that the close
to 20,000 of our employees are the most valuable asset
in the organization. They fully recognize the fact that with a
well-motivated and energized work force, is .key to achieving
company goals and objectives .
The Human Resources Management in Alok is concerned
with the people’s dimension in the organization, facilitating
the competencies and retention of skilled force, developing
management systems that promote commitment, practices
that foster team work and flexibility, making employees feel
valued and rewarded.
The operative functions of Alok HR are to maintain health,
safety, welfare & social security of employees to ensure
hygienic workplace, integration of employment relations,
grievance & discipline.
The objectives of Human Resources Management at Alok are

Statutory Section
Management Discussion and Analysis
Innovative Textile Solutions 75
to be ethically & socially responsible to the needs of the society
while minimizing the negative impact of such demands upon
the organization, to recognize the role of Human Resources
Management in bringing about organizational effectiveness, to
maintain the department’s contribution at a level appropriate
to the organization’s needs, to assist employees in achieving
their personal goals in a manner that their personal goals
enhance the individual’s contribution to the organization.
The foundation of our HR ethos starts from our scientific
recruitment methodology and our design of remuneration and
promotion policies. The recruitment policy ensure that it has
the right number & kind of people at the right place and at
the right time, capable of effectively and efficiently completing
those tasks that help the organization achieve its overall
objectives. We have a sustained recruitment of fresh talent
from the leading Textile institutes of the country and we are
very proud of the fact that in almost all of them, we are on
their list of preferred employers. The HR team at Alok has
been successfully driving the Induction program to reduce
the anxiety level of new employees and introduce them to the
organization.
A very high proportion of these fresh recruits have stayed with
us for long periods and has grown with the Organisation. Our
remuneration package also has a large in- built flexibility to suit
individual needs and preferences. There is a constant drive
to keep the motivation levels of employees high and let them
take part in operating decisions. The feeling of ownership in
our staff has been the main reason of our success in keeping
our attrition rates one of the lowest in the industry.
The backbone of our entire HR is the culture of meritocracy.
We have a very robust Performance Management system,
which identifies and rewards exemplary performance and fast
tracks high performers. The system also helps in analyzing
the skill gaps in employees and addressing these gaps
effectively through well designed training programs, both
in-house and in reputed institutes. Training process at Alok
includes - identifying training needs & implementing training
programs. Training in Alok is a process of teaching employees
the basic skills they need to perform their jobs or developing
additional skills. The company’s training programs support it’s
strategic goals. Also training in Alok is a part of larger issue
of performance management. Hence, Alok follows each step
in training process completely and thoroughly because each
builds on the other. Alok believes “A well constructed training
program is worth the required effort”
Employee welfare is an integral part of Alok and ranges from
arranging farewell parties, parting gifts, festival celebrations
etc., annual get togetherness to adherence to mandated
provisions of law.
The company believes in and strongly promotes team work
rather than individual excellence. A lot of stress is given to
develop employees skills in teamwork. Top management is
specially trained in team building, team nurturing and cohesive
teamwork.
Strategic Investments
In addition to the core textiles operations with manufacturing
facilities in India, the Company has diversified its business
scope by making investments into subsidiaries and associate
companies. While some of these investments were to reach
out to new markets, others were made to fill a gap in the
complete textile industry value chain. The outlays in the realty

H&A: Domestic Retail
The Company’s domestic retail operations are today carried
out through the cash and carry company called ‘Alok H&A
Ltd’, a 100% subsidiary of the company and Alok Retail India
limited. In the initial phase, the Company expanded its H&A
chain of stores at a rapid pace. After revaluation of the business
strategy, the Company has actively worked on winding up the
stores developed and in effect exited the business.
Store Twenty One: UK Retail
Alok Group presently has a stake of 99.87% in Grabal Alok
(UK) Ltd, the company that operates the ‘Store Twenty One’
chain of value-format stores in UK. Today, the chain comprises
221 stores, which offer a value proposition for quality apparel
for women, men, and children. They also sell accessories
like artificial jewellery, shoes, leather bags, and toys, which
complement the apparel range.
The economic slowdown and low consumer confidence in
UK severely affected this business. It witnessed a slowdown
in sales and consequently generated operational losses.
The Company is reviewing its strategy for the business. The
Company is actively looking at options to exit this business
given an appropriate valuation
Subsidiaries - Real Estate
The Company has also made investments in the realty sector.
The focus in this business is to create value from the existing
investments and monetise the assets in an opportunistic
manner. Already, with the projects reaching different levels
of completion, Alok is starting to work on monetising these
assets and utilising the cash to retire debt. The details of the

the stock exchanges viz., BSE Limited and National Stock Exchange Limited;
(b)
The company has prima facie complied with Secretarial Standards 1 & 2 issued by the Institute of Company Secretaries of India.

During the period under review the Company has prima facie complied with the provisions of the Act, Rules, Regulations, Guidelines,
Standards, etc.
I further report that:
(a)
The Company is yet to appoint a women director after vacancy created on 17th December, 2015 as per section 149 of the Companies Act,
(b)
The Boards constitutions is yet not in compliance with the provision of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements), Regulations,
2015.
(c)
The Company is yet to pay the debenture interest payment due for a period beyond one year as at the Balance sheet date. This attracts the
provisions of Section 164 (2) and 167 of the Companies Act, 2013. The company has taken legal opinion for Section 167 of the said Act as
the same appears ambiguous regarding the vacation of the Board, if and when such a contravention continues. The Company is informed
that the Company Law Committee appointed by the Government of India has already recommended appropriate amendments to Section
167 to remove the apparent ambiguity. The Company is further informed the recommendation has been incorporated in the Companies
(Amendment) Bill, 2016 which has been introduced in the Lok Sabha for discussion and is pending for conﬁ rmation.
(d)
During the year the Company was required to amend the Authorized Share Capital of the Company to Rs. 4,000 crore from Rs. 1,500
crore through an Extra Ordinary General Meeting (EOGM) in order to accommodate the conversion of debt into equity under the SDR
provisions. A Singapore based bank led consortium through their security trustee, Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC)
ﬁ led a petition in the Bombay High Court for winding up the company and further prayed for stalling the EOGM to protect their interest. The
Court, however, allowed the the EOGM to be conducted on submission of an afﬁ davit by the Company that the resolutions passed at the
EOGM for change in capital structure will not be implemented without obtaining prior written approval from HSBC. The Company has since
written a letter to the Registrar of Companies, Ahmedabad citing the circumstances due to which the change in capital structure cannot be
implemented.
I further report that:
(a) I rely on statutory auditors’ reports in relation to the ﬁ nancial statements, qualiﬁ cations and accuracy of ﬁ nancial ﬁ gures for, Sales Tax,
Wealth Tax, Value Added Tax, Related Party Transactions, Provident Fund, ESIC, FERA etc. as disclosed under ﬁ nancial statements and
I have not veriﬁ ed the correctness and appropriateness of the books of accounts of the Company including loans & guarantees to the
domestic and overseas subsidiaries and the Consultants report in relation to the other applicable Laws.
(b) As per the information provided the company has prima facie given adequate notice to all directors to schedule the Board Meetings,
agenda and detailed notes on agenda were sent at least seven days in advance, and a system exists for seeking and obtaining further
information and clariﬁ cations on agenda items before the meeting and for meaningful participation at the meeting.
(c)
As per the information provided majority decision is carried through while the dissenting members’ views are captured and recorded as part
of the minutes.
(d) There are prima facie adequate systems and processes in the company commensurate with the size and operations of the company to
monitor and ensure compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and guidelines.
(e) The management is responsible for compliances of all business laws. This responsibility includes maintenance of statutory registers/ﬁ les

Management Discussion and Analysis
Alok Industries (‘Alok’ or ‘the Company’) is one of India’s leading
textiles company with a presence across the value chain of both cotton
and polyester products. The Company services a wide customer base
spread across the world including major global marquee brands and
also has certain international operations. The year under review
was a very challenging year due to a variety of reasons including
slump in the polyester sector across the globe, liquidity crunch
and a highly leveraged ﬁ nancial position. This led to the company
facing considerable stress and consequently being considered for
a ‘Strategic Debt Restructuring’ by its consortium of working capital
lenders.
Economic Overview
World
Although the global ﬁ nancial crisis is now seven years behind us,
the world’s economy is still struggling to regain momentum. Growth
continues to falter in advanced economies and, while there is
considerable divergence of performance across emerging market and
developing economies, their overall growth remains below potential.
Emerging market and developing economies face challenges,
including the fall-out of sluggish advanced economy growth, tighter
ﬁ nancial conditions, and stubbornly low commodity prices, though
the latter impacts economies differently, depending on their nature
of trade. Exporters of oil and other key commodities have been
particularly hard hit, while their importers have been more resistant to
economic headwinds.
In advanced economies, investment continues to be soft amid weaker
growth prospects and elevated policy uncertainty, while export growth
has slowed reﬂ ecting subdued external demand. Despite an expected
boost from lower energy prices, and the ongoing improvement in labor
markets, growth is projected to level off in Calendar Year (CY) 2016
rather than accelerate.
Emerging and Developing markets started CY2016 with weaker
manufacturing
activity.
Investment
growth
has
also
slowed
substantially, especially in commodity exporters, partly reﬂ ecting
tightened domestic policies and weak capital inﬂ ows. In China, a
gradual domestic rebalancing is under way, with robust growth in
services and policy support measures mitigating the slowdown in
industrial activity. Brazil and the Russian Federation are still mired
in recession. Global merchandise trade remains subdued, reﬂ ecting
rebalancing in China and weaker demand from commodity exporters,
which together contributed to an outright contraction in overall
Emerging and developing market merchandise imports in 2015.
Data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), reported in the
World Economic Outlook (WEO), April 2016, suggests that world
economic output reduced from 3.4% in CY2014 to 3.1% in CY2015.
While advanced economies remained steady at their lower levels of
growth – 1.9% in CY2015 compared to 1.8% in CY2014, emerging
markets and developing economies saw growth reduce from 4.6% in
CY2014 to 4% in CY2015. Chart A gives the details.
Source: IMF estimates, Note:*2016 is a forecast
Amidst this uncertainty, a positive for consumers was the continuing
reduction in commodity prices, driven primarily by crude oil. As Chart
B shows, oil prices, which were at levels of over US$100/barrel at the
beginning of FY2015, had reduced to levels of US$50/barrel by the
beginning of FY2016. The secular downward trend continued through
FY2016 and touched around US$30/barrel in December 2015. With
this reduction, there was some respite in terms of cost of operations.
Importantly, logistics costs diminished.
Major advanced economies are at different stages of their post-crisis
recovery but are expected to stabilize around a weak growth trajectory.
In the US, softer-than-expected activity since the start of
CY2016 has led to downward revisions to growth projections. Sectors
that rely on oil-related activities or exports have faced increasing
headwinds. Low oil prices, and associated ﬁ nancial stress, has led to
a collapse of capital expenditure in the energy sector. As for external
trade, a strong U.S. dollar and weakening demand from emerging
markets contributed to stalling exports. In contrast, above-trend
gains in real disposable income, on the back of robust job creation
and falling energy prices, continue to support private consumption as
the main engine of growth. Labor market slack is diminishing, but a
cyclical recovery in labor participation and a still elevated number of
discouraged and involuntary part-time workers suggest a persistent
and sizable pool of underutilized labor.
Management Discussion and Analysis

FAITH FOCUS COMMITMENT
29th Annual Report | 1st April, 2015 to 31st March, 2016
The recovery in the Euro Area is progressing at a moderate pace,
supported by an exceptional level of monetary policy accommodation,
low oil prices, and slightly expansionary ﬁ scal policies. However,
weak external demand, renewed domestic uncertainties and broader
geopolitical risks continue to weigh on conﬁ dence and activity. Private
consumption has been resilient, and persistently low oil prices and
improved labor market conditions should help consolidate gains in
CY2016.
In China, gradual domestic rebalancing is under way. A sharp
slowdown in industrial activity has thus far been mitigated by steady
growth in the services sector. In CY2015, the services sector
accounted for half of GDP and the majority of new urban jobs. This
helped to offset layoffs in shrinking industrial sectors and kept urban
labor markets tight. In addition, consumption growth continued to be
robust, contributing largely to GDP growth in CY2015, almost double
of what was contributed by investments.
India
Despite global economic slowdown, growth trends in the Indian
economy have been encouraging. As Chart C shows, real GDP
growth has been improving steadily from a low of 5.6% in FY2013 to
7.6% in FY2016. Today, India is the fastest growing large economy in
the world.
Source: Central Statistical Organisation (CSO), Government of India
Additionally, its other macroeconomic parameters like inﬂ ation, ﬁ scal
deﬁ cit and current account balance have exhibited distinct signs of
improvement. Wholesale price inﬂ ation has been in negative territory
for more than a year and the all-important consumer prices inﬂ ation
has declined to nearly half of what it was a few years ago. As Chart D
shows, compared to 10.9% CPI inﬂ ation in 2013, the level was down
to 5.9% in 2015. With inﬂ ation under control, the Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) has eased monetary policy and reduced the benchmark repo
rate in three instalments by a total of 100 basis points. Consequently,
lending rates have reduced marginally. The base rate for scheduled
commercial banks, which was 10.25% in ﬁ nancial year (FY) 2014 has
reduced to 9.7% by the end of FY2016. Having said so, interest rates
need to come down further to really bolster investments.
Source: MOSPI, Government of India
On the one hand, the lower inﬂ ation and softening of and softening
of interest rates auger well for consumption led growth of the real
economy in India, on the other hand, the variance in the pace at
which inﬂ ation and interest rates have reduced poses a problem for
investment led manufacturing growth. Chart E shows that real interest
rate, which is the difference between the base rate of banks (median
value of rates of scheduled commercial banks) and inﬂ ation measured
by the wholesale price index, has actually increased steadily between
FY2011 and FY2015. This was at a time when economic demand was
faltering. Such a development has had a lasting effect on return on
investments in manufacturing and has contributed to the deteriorating
quality of assets of the banking sector.
Source: Economic Adviser, Government of India
While there is much to cheer, there are also certain concerns. Weak
growth in advanced and emerging economies has taken its toll on India’s
exports. In fact, exports reduced by 6.3% over 2015-16. Thankfully,
imports have also declined, principally on account of reduced prices
of crude oil for which the country is heavily dependent on imports and,
hence, the trade and current account deﬁ cits continue to be moderate.
Growth in agriculture has slackened due to two successive years of
less than-normal monsoon rains. Saving and investment rates are
showing hardly any signs of revival. The Rupee has depreciated vis-
à-vis the US dollar, like most other currencies in the world, although
less so in magnitude. At the same time, it has appreciated against a
number of other major currencies. More importantly, the economy has
not yet realised close to its potential as several reform measures are
yet to take off and make any material impact. Several key initiatives
like the ones for start-ups and the ‘Make in India’ campaign are yet
to be meaningfully implemented. The all-important reform of Goods
and Services Tax (GST) remains a legislative challenge. Hopefully,

the GST Bill will be passed in the course of 2016-17, as it must for
India to reap the beneﬁ ts it deserves.
Textiles, Clothing and Fibre Industry
Global Scenario
The textiles and apparel industry is highly matured and has strong
correlations with global macro-economic developments. The industry
relies on transnational specialization and involves a healthy level of
global trade. The macro-economic trend of shifting manufacturing
operations in the mid to lower value stream of the industry to relative
low cost emerging economies is quite widespread for textiles and
apparels. Also, new avenues of growth in demand are primarily
in emerging markets, while the sheer size of the large advanced
economies like USA and Europe still remain the largest markets for
the global industry.
The global textile and apparel industry will continue to grow along with
growing consumption of textile and apparel products in developing
countries and a gradual economic recovery of major developed
markets. The growth of conventional textile products is driven by
apparel segment which constitutes majority share of total demand.
As the market continues to evolve, new consumption centers for
apparel and home textiles are emerging. While the apparel market is
still largely dominated by EU and USA, countries like China, India and
Russia are emerging as future destinations for apparel consumption.
The high growth in the market will be primarily driven by the increase
in population as well as the per capita apparel spending of the already
large population in these countries. It is estimated that the global
apparel market will be around US$ 2.6 Trillion by 2025 growing at a
CAGR of 4% per annum. This high growth in apparel consumption
in developing economies will further drive the growth of textile
manufacturing and trade in these countries. Table 1 gives present and
projected consumption of Apparels in different regions and leading
countries.

Per capita apparel consumption in developing countries like India and
China is expected to increase by more than 2 times in next 10 years
and make these the drivers of incremental growth, while the advanced
markets will still remain important because of their sheer size. Table

the world’s leading textiles and apparel markets.

Along with the growing consumption, global textile and apparel trade
is estimated at US$820 bn and has grown at 5.6% CAGR since 2005
and is expected to grow further at 6.3% CAGR and reach US$1600
bn by 2025 as shown in Chart G. Presently, apparel constitutes more
than half of the share of the global textile and apparel trade followed
by fabric and yarn. Growth in global trade will bring about investments
in the countries having strong supply base for apparel and textile
products. India will be one of the gainers from investment point of
view.

Global Trade in Textiles and Apparel in 2015
Import demand for textiles and apparel at the global level continues to
be driven by the advance economies of USA and EU. Together, they

2015 was as such a tough year for many of Asia’s exporters. But,
while exporters of commodities and electronics suffered, the apparels
and textiles sector held up remarkably well. Those exporters in the
region that depended heavily on garments by and large outperformed
their rivals. In many cases, these countries occupy the lower end of
the apparel value chain, but the stability of the sector’s performance
has highlighted its important role as a driver of labor-intensive
development for Asia’s emerging markets.
The relative trends in competitiveness between Asia’s main garment
and textile exporters are broadly correlated with data from the US
government’s Ofﬁ ce of Textiles and Apparel. These show that Asian
suppliers accounted for roughly three-quarters of the total US imports
of such products. China’s share of the US market remains dominant,
although the share has marginally slipped compared to 2014. The
share of apparel and garment imports coming from members of the
Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), by contrast, edged
up largely owing to higher imports from Vietnam: other ASEAN nations
such as Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines lost market share.
Collectively, the share of South Asian economies in US garment
and textile import has grown closer to the levels reached by ASEAN
countries. Interestingly, the performance of Indian and Sri Lankan
exporters in the US has been signiﬁ cantly better than that of their
domestic apparel export sectors overall.
The big shifts in exchange rates—both within Asia and in other
emerging markets—that was seen in the last half of 2015 – will
probably have a signiﬁ cant impact on the apparel trade in the next
few years. Margins in the sector tend to be narrow, and so currency
movements can have a signiﬁ cant effect on national competitiveness.
Nevertheless, many of the underlying trends evident in 2015 look set
to continue. China’s rising domestic costs are unlikely to be fully offset
by the depreciation of the Renminbi that we expect to see in 2016, but
the speed of the low-end garment export sector’s departure to other
markets will depend partly on the level of support that the Chinese
government supplies to local producers. Garment sectors in India
and Sri Lanka will continue to struggle with lackluster EU demand
in the next few years, but their rising sales in the US will provide
some offsetting support. Meanwhile, the rise of apparel producers
in Bangladesh and Vietnam has been evident for several years, and
there is no sign that their share of the global market will peak in the
near future.
Less positively, mid-tier producers in countries like Cambodia,
Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Pakistan will have to do more
to match their rivals in this increasingly tough market. Prospects for
the garment sector in all ﬁ ve countries look fragile, particularly as new
and even cheaper countries like Myanmar emerge as potential sites
for production. Apparel exports may be holding up better than those
of commodities and electronics, but competition in the sector remains
cut-throat.
Thus, the global textile market is expected to grow and the key take
aways are:
The global apparel consumption will increase from USD 1.7
trillion in 2015 to USD 2.6 trillion by 2025
Developing / Emerging economies will drive the apparel market
growth
Per Capita expenditure on apparel in developed countries in a
decade from now will still be far more than that in developing
nations
China and India will be the fastest growing apparel markets, both
growing in double digits
China will become the biggest apparel market adding more than
USD 378 bn in market size by 2025. India will be the second
most attractive apparel market adding USD 121 bn by 2025

India Textile and Apparel Export Market
In the last 10 years, India has leveraged some of the global
opportunities and grown its exports. Since FY2006, although there
have been ﬂ uctuations in some years, overall textile and apparel
exports grew at a CAGR of 10.6% to reach US$42 billion in 2014
(Table 4).

While exports to US and EU had picked up there was strong
competition not only from China but from other low cost countries like
Vietnam and Bangladesh.
Though textiles exports provided a sizable 13% of all exports from India,
the country’s share in global textile trade still remains low at around 5%,
but the potential is immense particularly as the leader China, the global
leader is facing higher cost of production with increase in wages and
focusing on a shift to services, and some of the other competing countries
witnessing political instability, high inﬂ ation, currency appreciation and
concerns over workplace conditions. Table 5 gives competitive advantage

It can be summarised that Indian Textile industry is poised for a growth
as under:
Global textile and apparel textile industry market & trade is
growing and will continue to do so in future
India’s growing domestic market will also provide major boost to
the textile & apparel industry
Global trade trends will favour India as a promising textile and
apparel base
Fundamentals of Indian textile manufacturing are strong and
makes India globally competitive
High investments are required across the value chain to cater to
the future demand potential
Indian government is also providing good support to textile
industry
India has huge potential to increase its product basket especially
in MMF textiles
Indian textile companies are also growing in size and scale and
becoming globally competitive
Overall India’s Textile and Apparel sector is well placed to tap the
huge market opportunity and consolidate its global position.
Business Strategy
Being one of India’s leading textiles manufacturers, Alok Industries has
the global scale of operations and has presence in global markets. It is
ready for the opportunities available in the growing global apparel and
textiles market for Indian Textile Industry. The strategy followed was
to create globally competitive capabilities across the value chain –
from yarn to weaving to specialised products. Alok uniquely positioned
itself in both apparel and home textiles segments and covered both
the cotton and polyester product streams.
While each of these business divisions are like independent value
generating entities, the focus was on offering product basket to cater
to our ever demanding customers and for the stake holders. We
built up global scale of operations, which are essential to compete
in the global market place and focus on diversiﬁ cation in product and
markets.

Management Discussion and Analysis
In a bid to further diversify the business risks and leverage market
opportunities, the Company had also invested into certain new
initiatives that were in addition to its core textiles manufacturing
operations out of India. This included acquisition of Mileta, a Czech
Republic based integrated textiles player; UK based retail venture
called ‘Store Twenty One’ through its step down subsidiary Grabal Alok
(UK) Limited and real estate investments through Alok Infrastructure
Limited, its 100% subsidiary. Across all these businesses, the focus
was on enhancing value. However, most of these initiatives on one
hand have not yielded the desired results and increased the leverage
of the Company on the other hand. Now, the Company is exploring the
possibility to monetise these assets to deleverage the balance sheet.
This entire endeavour at expanding for global positioning warranted
large scale investments, which was largely debt ﬁ nanced. In addition,
the diversiﬁ ed operations also required large ﬁ nancing support not
only to create but also for the gestation period till a self-sustaining
level is realised.
Consequently, while the Company has created and developed
the requisite infrastructure to take advantage of global market
opportunities, it has also to deal with a highly ﬁ nancially leveraged
balance sheet. Over the last few years, as the Company developed
its higher capacities and diversiﬁ ed into other business, external
environment became subdued. India as well as global markets went
through a phase of economic slowdown and uncertainties. As a
result, the Company could not exit some of its overseas and domestic
real estate business and the burden of servicing debt has grown
signiﬁ cantly on its Textile business operations.
The Company has already initiated steps to exit from its non-core
businesses. In this context, the Company has already closed its
domestic retail (H & A) business by shutting down the stores set
up across India. It has also got traction in selling material portions
of its commercial real estate units, which were located in Mumbai.
The Company is continuing its efforts to sell majority of it non-core
assets in the next ﬁ nancial year and use the proceeds to reduce debt.
However, market conditions, today are not very conducive to make
such asset sales in a reasonable span of time. Towards this end, the
company has entered into an MOU to sell its Czech based unit “Mileta
International’. If all the requirements of the MOU are satisfactorily met,
the trade is expected to get concluded by March 2017/ June 2017.
The proceeds of the same would be used to repay the acquisition debt
ﬁ nanced by the banks.
The reasons for the Company’s present tight liquidity situation can be
summarised as under:
Temporary miss-match of funds caused due to bunching of
repayments of core and non-core loans.
Substantial amount from operations was used to service debt
resulting in tight working capital situation impacting operations.
This was further aggravated by the higher receivables & Inventory
in the domestic market for woven fabric due to tight liquidity.
Increase in average interest cost from about 7% per annum in FY
Delay in monetization of non-core assets due to depressed
economic conditions which resulted in additional burden of
interest of non core business loans on core textile business.
Delay in sanction/ release of credit facilities and delay in
receiving export advances against the Export Performance Bank
Guarantee.
Consequently, the Company is going through a very tight phase in
terms of liquidity in the system, which is preventing it from growing
revenues and generating cash. In November 2015 (reference date
27.11.2015), banks invoked the SDR (Strategic Debt Restructuring)
to work out a viable solution for the Company. Under SDR, Banks
agreed in principle to convert debt of Rs. 2557.88 crore into equity
i.e. 2,55,78,76,091 equity shares of Rs. 10 each to take a controlling
stake of 65% in the company.
Alok has passed necessary enabling resolution in its Board meeting
held on 30.01.2016 as well as obtained shareholders’ approval in the
Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) held on 14.03.2016 to increase
authorized share capital and allow conversion of debt to equity under
the SDR Scheme by way of fresh issue of equity shares. So far banks
have not asked the company to issue shares under SDR. There was
also a case ﬁ led by a Singapore based bank led consortium of banks
for winding up of the Company for non-payment of their dues and they
have also restricted the further issue of shares without their approval.
There are some other cases ﬁ led on the company by banks/ institutions
& suppliers for recovering their dues. Most of these cases are being
pursued due to uncertainty about the way forward for the Company.
We believe, once the deﬁ nite course of action about the revival of the
Company is known, most of the legal cases ﬁ led on the Company
would also get addressed.
The Company is working with all ﬁ nancial stake holders to evolve an
effective debt recasting programme and exploring various avenues
to induct capital into the system and continue operations as a ‘going
concern’.

Exports
In a highly competitive export market where Alok has strong
established relations with large marquee customers, Alok’s business
was affected due to liquidity issues affecting production that could
service export orders. Consequently, export sales reduced to Rs.1,
223.49 crore in the current year as against Rs. 3861.60 crore in the
previous 18 months period. However, going forward there will be
renewed emphasis to grow exports.
Table 12 gives the share of different regions in Alok’s exports. The

In addition to the certiﬁ cations, Alok’s performance, especially in
exports have been recognized.
Information Technology (IT)
Alok has always looked at IT as a business enabler to optimize its
processes and build a competitive edge. Implementation of appropriate
new technology and up-gradation of IT tools is an on-going process at
Alok. The Company had already made signiﬁ cant investments and for
much of the current ﬁ nancial year, the focus was on consolidating the
existing systems and deriving returns for business functions.
Some highlights for the year include:
SAP application has been running seamlessthrough the ﬁ nancial year.
Technical and function team worked continuously on enhancing the
performance and consolidating various SAP functions.
Database replication using Oracle log shipping and vision software
are working seamlessly. Regular data backup and above mentioned
replication mechanisms ensure a very high recovery point objective
(RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO).
Disaster recovery system running “Double Take” application is
working seamlessly and online with the production system.
Data centre was fully functional with no signiﬁ cant downtime, meeting
all business requirements. Adequate power backup with multiple
UPS systems conﬁ gured in auto-failover mode provide uninterrupted
power supply for the infrastructure. Access to data enter is controlled
through face reader devices.
Human Resource
The fundamental driver of any Company is its people and at Alok
Industries there has always been extended focus on the Management
of Human Resources. It is widely recognised that the Company’s
employees are the most valuable asset to the organization and
will play a pivotal role in helping the business overcome its present
challenges. The belief is that with a well-motivated and energized
work force, nothing is impossible.
Human Resources (HR) Management at Alok is concerned primarily
works on facilitating the competencies and retention of skilled
people, developing management systems that promote commitment,
promoting practices that foster team work and ﬂ exibility and
continuously striving to make employees feel valued and rewarded.
At the operation level, in the manufacturing process, HR activities at
Alok focus on maintaining health, safety, welfare and social security of
employees to ensure hygienic workplace, integration of employment
relations, grievance and discipline.
The primary objective HR at Alok is to bring about organisational
effectiveness by helping employees achieve their personal goals in a
manner that enhances the overall performance of the Company. In this
endeavour, there is strong focus on promoting team work rather than
individual excellence. A lot of focus is given to develop employees’
skills in teamwork and senior management is specially trained in
promoting team building, team nurturing and cohesive teamwork.
The HR function is built on a strong foundation of utilising recruitment
methodology and design of remuneration and promotion policies. The
recruitment methodology ensures that there are right number and
appropriate kind of people at the right place and at the right time,
capable of effectively and efﬁ ciently completing those tasks that help
the organization achieve its overall objectives. There is a process of
sustained recruitment of fresh talent from the leading textile institutes
of the country. The HR team at Alok has been successfully driving
the Induction programmes to effectively integrate new employees and
introduce them to the organization.
A very high proportion of these fresh recruits has stayed with us for
long periods and has grown with the Organisation. The Company’s
remuneration package also has a large in- built ﬂ exibility to suit
individual needs and preferences. There is a constant drive to keep up
the motivation levels of employees and let them take part in operating
decisions. The feeling of ownership of the Company amongst
employees has been the main reason for Alok’s success in keeping
attrition rates at one of the lowest levels in the industry.
This is further enhanced by adopting a strong culture of meritocracy.
These are a very robust Performance Management system, which
identiﬁ es and rewards exemplary performance and fast tracks
high performers. The system also helps in analyzing the skill gaps
in employees and addressing these gaps effectively through well
designed training programs, both in-house and in reputed institutes.
Training process at Alok includes - identifying training needs &
implementing training programs. Training in Alok is a process of
teaching employees the basic skills they need to perform their jobs
or developing additional skills. The ﬁ rms training programs support
its strategic goals. Also training in Alok is a part of larger issue of
performance management.
Employee welfare is an integral part of Alok. This includes arranging
Festival Celebrations, Women’s Day Celebration, Regular get-
together and Outings, Concessional meals, etc.
Strategic Investments
The Company has made investments in overseas businesses to reach
out to new markets and enhance overall value of its business. The
outlays in the realty business were also made to maximise returns.
However, most of these investments did not yield the desired outcome
and the Company is now actively working on selling its stake and
recovering investments made to repay debt.
Subsidiaries - Textiles
Mileta
Through its step down subsidiary Alok Industries International Limited,
Alok has 100% stake in Mileta, a Czech based fabric manufacturing
company. Mileta’s facilities are located in Horice (Weaving and
Administration) and Cerny Dul (Processing) in the Czech Republic.
Mileta has high end technological skill in yarn-dyed fabrics and
hemming that results in higher per unit realisations. The Mileta range
of products includes handkerchiefs, high quality shirting, batistes and
voiles, complete line of functional table linen and bed linen. Their
brands including ‘Mileta’, ‘Erba’, ‘Cottonova’, ‘Wall Street’ and ‘Lord
Nelson’ are being introduced in the Indian domestic market. Alok also
uses Mileta’s extensive marketing network in Europe, Russia and
Africa to promote its existing products.

FAITH FOCUS COMMITMENT
29th Annual Report | 1st April, 2015 to 31st March, 2016
The Company’s business was under pressure due to competitive
environment in Europe. The Company achieved sales of Rs. 159.6 crore
and proﬁ t after tax of Rs. 6.5 crore for the year ended 31st March 2016.
Subsidiaries - Retail
The company has entered into an MOU to sell its stake in Mileta. If all
the requirements of the MOU are satisfactorily met, the transaction is
expected to get concluded by March 2017/ June 2017. The proceeds
of the same would be used to repay the acquisition debt ﬁ nanced by
the banks.
Store Twenty One: UK Retail
Alok holds 99.87% equity in Grabal Alok (UK) Ltd (Grabal (UK),
the company that operates the ‘Store Twenty One’ chain of value-
format stores in UK, through its step down subsidiary Alok Industries
International Limited and Grabal Alok International Limited. The
chain comprises of about 220 stores, which offer a value proposition
for quality apparel for women, men, and children. They also sell
accessories like artiﬁ cial jewellery, shoes, leather bags, and toys,
which complement the apparel range.
The economic slowdown and low consumer conﬁ dence in UK
continues to affect this business. Grabal (UK) achieved sales of Rs.
882.8 crore and made losses of Rs. 92.10 crore for the year ended 31st
March 2016. Alok Industries is looking at options to exit this business
given the right opportunity.
Subsidiaries - Real Estate
The Company has also made investments in the realty sector. The
focus in this business is to create value from the existing investments
and monetise the assets in an opportunistic manner. Already, with the
projects reaching different levels of completion, Alok is starting to work
on monetising these assets and utilising the cash to retire debt. The
position of sale and leasing out of the real estate assets is given in

During the year, the Company has monetized its Ashford Centre
property and the consideration of Rs.62 crores has been utilised for
payment of loans taken against the said property thereby reducing
high cost consolidated debt. The total loan outstanding debt against
non-core assets is Rs.1321 crore and accordingly net realization to
Alok would be Rs.379 crore
In case of Peninsula Business Park, there is one ﬂ oor of 31542 sq.
feet yet to be sold as there is a dispute regarding certain payments
with the developer. The company has gone in for arbitration and a
resolution is awaited. Also, the Company has given mandate for sale
of land portfolio to M/s. Jones Lang LaSalle however, looking at the
current economic scenario, it will be challenging for the company to
realize its plans on this front in a short span of time.

Sustainable Business Practices and Corporate Social
Responsibility (CSR)
Alok has always strived to be a leader in sustainable integrated,
textile solutions delivering value through environmentally and socially
responsible textile products. In addition to its commitments towards
quality and health, safety and environment there are certain speciﬁ c
initiatives that related to sustainability and social development.
Ethical Fibre
At the ﬁ rst stage of its value chain is procurement of cotton, which is
the Company’s predominant ﬁ bre utilisation. Increasingly, the world is
witnessing the promotion of ethical ﬁ bres like
Organic cotton, which is cotton grown without the use of external
synthetic agricultural inputs like fertilizers and pesticides and
helps conserve the environment from the harmful effects of the
use of hazardous agro chemicals
Fair Trade cotton ﬁ bre
Better Cotton, which involves educating the cotton growers to
adopt the Best Management Practices in cotton cultivation for
more sustainable yields
Recycled cotton and polyester for our state of the art spinning
plant.
A shift from conventional ﬁ bre use to these ethical variants signiﬁ cantly
reduces the environmental impact of growing conventional, resource
intensive cotton and help marginal cotton growers economize on farm
expenses.
Alok has led from the forefront amongst Indian companies adopting
use of such ﬁ bres. The Company is GOTS certiﬁ ed and a member of
Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) quality manufacturer supplying Organic
and Better Cotton textile products to the world’s leading brands in
Europe and the US. As a Fair Trade (FLO) certiﬁ ed company, Alok
values the fair price concept across the value chain. The Company
has taken initiative and been instrumental in a few of the well-known
Organic and Fair Trade cotton projects in India and abroad.
Similarly Cotton made in Africa (CMiA) is another important variant of
sustainable cotton type Alok is into and supplies its quality products to
sophisticated markets in parts of Europe.
Sustainable Manufacturing
In addition, Alok remains committed to sustainable manufacturing
operations, which also implies use of newer and cleaner technology,
use of eco-friendly dyes for all processing, treatment of post-dyeing
efﬂ uents, installation of reverse osmosis (RO) units to recover fresh
water from the treated one and installation of Selective Catalytic
Reduction (SCR) systems in the exhaust of the DG sets to reduce
oxides of Nitrogen.
The Company encourages the use of recycled products and has set
up a recycled polyester unit with an initial 20 tons/ day of capacity to
recycle polyester and polyester yarn waste, ﬂ akes and PET bottles to
produce 100% recycled polyester ﬁ bre.
Social Development
Alok has been regularly working on improving the quality of life in
communities where it operates by adopting measures that beneﬁ t
the local population in terms of direct and indirect employment. In the
process, the Company has also played an active role on providing
training and employment to local tribal women.
Alok has also established a school - Alok Public School - in Silvassa,
which already has a student, base of close to 500 and is a much
coveted school in the township and surrounding areas. The School
has been granted the much sought after CBSE afﬁ liation and also
recognized as a ‘New Generation’ CBSE school for its innovative",11815,0.755314143963047,[],False
ALok,,5210700317.pdf,2016-17,"As mentioned earlier, the overall performance of
Alok industries in recent past has been impacted by
low plant utilization levels due to unavailability of re-
quired working capital. However, once working capi-
tal requirement is addressed all the business divisions
of Alok are capable of running on self-sustaining basis
and there are good opportunities for each division to
grow. In the polyester division, Alok has developed
a very good reputation for quality and developed a
good brand name (Alok) for its polyester yarn in the
domestic and export market. The Company has de-
veloped strong network of agents and distributors for
marketing of its products both in the domestic and
export markets. Alok has a well-established Home
Textiles division. Its large scale and integrated opera-
tions, high product quality, competitive pricing and
timely delivery schedules has enabled it to add in its
portfolio of customers large reputed global retailers,
and importers over the years. The apparel fabric seg-
ment company is the largest revenue generator for
the company. Alok has been expanding its apparel
fabric capacities i.e. weaving, knitting and process-
ing from time to time and has emerged as the largest
supplier of Apparel fabrics. Alok is also offering more
value added products than before and its consumer
base includes globally renowned brands. Overall
Alok’s position in terms of its operational capabilities
are good technically and sustainable for each of the
divisions and capable of growing once the debt reso-
lution is achieved.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all our
stakeholders - our financers, our shareholders, our
employees, our customers, our vendors and our well-
wishers across the country and the globe for their tre-
mendous dedication, commitment and contribution
towards strengthening Alok over the years. We are
continuously working forward to fulfill our mission
of generating maximum value for our stakeholders.
I also wish to express my gratitude to fellow Board
members for their guidance and direction; and our
shareholders for placing their faith in us. I urge you
all to continue to repose faith in us as we strive to re-
solve current issues and turn the corner for a brighter
future.
Yours Sincerely

Global Economy Overview

Global economy strengthened in 2017. Global GDP
growth, which in 2016 was the weakest since the
global financial crisis at 3.2%, rose to 3.8% in 2017.
Major economic indicators continue to improve in
a majority of the countries, and approximately
2/3rd of countries globally witnessed stronger
growth in 2017 as compared to previous year.
At the global level, growth is expected to remain
stable at 3% in 2018 and 2019.

Chart 1 illustrates the growth in the overall global
economy along with advanced and emerging
economies. Advanced economies grew by 0.6
percentage points in 2017 to reach 2.3%, while
emerging markets and developing economies saw
growth of 0.4 percentage points in 2017 to reach
4.8%, as compared to 2016.

Global inflation remained stable in 2017 at a
rate of 3%1, increasing by 0.2 percentage points
from 2016. Despite low unemployment in many
developed economies, wage pressures generally
remained weak. This could be a result of rising
inequality and limited bargaining power of people
belonging to lower income scales.

Global productivity saw a cheerful uplift in 2017.
After growing by a rate of only 1.3% in 2015 and
2016, global labour productivity increased by
approximately 1.9% in 2017. Revival in global
investments has played an important role in
improving the global productivity levels. Growth
in labour productivity was observed in countries
across the globe. Among developed economies,
Japan, U.S. and Western Europe have witnessed
productivity growth strengthening over the
past year, albeit from low levels. Average labour
productivity growth in developed economies is
estimated to have increased from 0.5% in 2016 to

The U.S. economy performed well in 2017,
according to the key  economic indicators.
U.S.’s  GDP growth rate  improved from 1.5%
in 2016 to 2.3% in 2017, and it is expected to
remain between 2%-3%  range in near future.
Unemployment rate stood at 4.4% in 2017,
declining marginally by 0.5 percentage points as
compared to previous year. Inflation/average
consumer price index stood at 245 in 2017,
increasing at 2% y-o-y as compared to 2016.1 This
is a positive sign for the US economy as inflation
is returning to target i.e. 2%. Labour productivity
saw an average annual growth of ~0.8% during
the last decade (2008-2017), however much lower
than the 1997-2007 annual growth of 2%3.

2 World Economic Situation and Prospects, 2018, United Nations
3 Economic Survey of the United States, 2018, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)

After years of crisis, European Union economy is
gaining momentum. European Union’s economy
witnessed y-o-y growth of 0.6 percentage points
in 2017 to reach at a level of 2.6% while inflation
increased to 1.7% as compared to 0.2% in 2016.
Rise in inflation was primarily because of increase
in prices of oil and fruit & vegetables as a result
of bad weather conditions. Unemployment rate in
EU saw a downward trend last year, declining from
7.6% in 2016 to 7.4% in 2017.1 As of now, UK’s
vote to exit the European Union, low potential
growth, and an ageing population are all important
challenges for EU’s economy. For strengthening of
economic condition, the European Union would
need to focus on development of policies that
support a stronger and more inclusive growth.

Japan’s economy, world’s third largest, grew at
1.7% in 2017. Unemployment rate has declined
from 3.1% in 2016 to 2.9% in 2017. Inflation
remains low, i.e. 0.5% y-o-y growth in 2017.1 After
two decades of economic stagnation, Japan’s
return to growth may be hampered by the twin
challenges of an ageing population and the
mountain of public debt built up.

China’s GDP has been declining since 2010. Its
growth in 2017 remained high, pegged at 6.9% but
is expected to gradually decline as the population
is ageing and economy witnessing a shift from
investment to consumption focused. Total
investment, as percent of GDP has declined over
the past 5 years (47.2% in 2012 to 44.4 in 2017)
and is expected to decrease further.1

At an overall level, trade is anticipated to rise as
a result of the stronger domestic demand in the
US. In Europe too, economic activity in 2018 and
2019 is projected to remain stronger. Moreover,
the advanced economies in Asia are expected to
deliver stronger growth, while the emerging and
developing ones are expected to grow at around
6.5% over 2018-19, broadly the same as in 2017.
1.2
Indian Economy Overview

Indian economy is showing signs of recovery
after a continuous decline since 2015. Indian
economy is gradually recovering from the impact
of demonetization in late 2016 and GST rollout
around second quarter of 2017. Moreover, it is
anticipated that India will recover fast with time in
near future, bringing the major economic reforms
to action. Tax reforms can make growth more
inclusive in India and boost productivity.

Major policy changes like demonetization and GST
rollout may have dampened GDP growth in the
short-term, but it could also prove to have long-
term benefits. It enhanced digital transactions to a
large extent, which are now easier to track.

It is worth mentioning that, key financial
indicators like inflation and fiscal deficit improved
significantly in 2017. Inflation rate in 2017 saw
the largest decline since past four years. Average
inflation rate in India declined to 3.6 % in 2017 as
compared to 4.5 % in 2016.1 The decline in inflation
was broad-based across major commodity groups,
except housing, fuel and light. This decline in
inflation rate is attributed to weaker domestic
demand, combined with structural factors such
as better food management by the current
government. Fiscal deficit of the country has
reduced from a level of 4.5% of GDP in 2013-14
to 3.24% of GDP in 2017-184. Unemployment has
remained stagnant from last three years (2015-
17), at 3.5%.1 Moreover, it is encouraging to note
that, India got 100 rank in Ease of doing business
index, as per World Bank’s ‘Doing Business 2018:
Reforming to Create Jobs’ report climbing 30 ranks
over previous year.

During 2017, Government of India took several
steps towards strengthening of its workforce. For
instance, increased maternity benefits to 26 weeks
paid leaves from existing 12 weeks, increased
coverage for mandatory employee insurance i.e.
coverage increased from Rs 15,000 per month
to Rs 21,000 per month etc. Government also
has plans to make major labour law reforms at
the central and state levels and to introduce a
National Employment policy in order to promote
job creation and make growth more inclusive.

India’s Manufacturing Scenario

The Indian textile industry is one of the largest
in the world with a large raw material base and
manufacturing strength across the value chain.
Presence of mill sector and handloom both
makes India’s textile industry unique as compared
to other textile industries of the world. With
an installed capacity of more than 50 million
spindles and more than 8 Lakh rotors, India’s
textile industry is the second largest in the world.7
Traditional sectors like handloom, handicrafts
and power-loom units are the biggest source of
employment for millions of people based in rural
and semi urban parts of India.

Growth Drivers for the Indian Textile & Apparel
Industry

Rising disposable income of the country:
India has a large population base with
more than 1.25 billion people. About half
of India’s population is under 25 years.
Young population of India will soon turn into
working population, resulting in increased
disposable income of the country. As a
result of the increased purchasing power,
major lifestyle categories would witness a
boost in demand. Apparel would be one of
the most important categories among other
lifestyle products.

Women’s lifestyle shifting from home-
oriented to career oriented: Driven by
pressures of urban living, roles that an Indian
women have to play are getting redefined.
Along with household activities, women
have started contributing to household
income as well. India could boost its growth
by 1.5 percentage points to 9% per year if
around 50% of women join the work force.
Currently, rate of women’s participation in
workforce stands at 27% in India.7 Number
of working women in urban area is expected
to get doubled from 3 crore in 2016 to 6
crore in 20258. Increasing number of women
in the workforce will boost the demand for
women’s work-wear segment.

Shift from need based buying to aspiration
based buying: About a decade ago, people
in India purchased products as per their
requirements. But now, scenario has
changed completely. Consumers of India
have become more focused towards
improving
their
lifestyle
and
buying
aspiration based products more.

Increased urbanization: India has witnessed
a drastic increase in urban population
as a result of rising industrialization and
expansion of cities. Growing urban culture
is also affecting rural areas on a large
scale. Increased urbanization has caused
population of India to indulge more into the
purchase of fashion and lifestyle products.
This is going to have a major impact on
growth of apparel consumption in India.

Increased retail penetration: Growing
digitalization in India and increasing number
of internet users have resulted in surge
in online shopping. People find online
shopping more convenient and versatile in
terms of discounts, payment methods and
return/exchange. Growth in online retail will
also boost apparel sales in India.
Business Strategy
Alok Industries has created global scale of operations
across its value chain and has enjoyed significant
presence in domestic polyester filament yarn industry
and global textile markets in the earlier years. The
objective was to be prepared for the growing global
apparel and textiles market for Indian Textile Industry.
The strategy, accordingly was to create globally
competitive capabilities across the value chain in cotton
and polyester - to provide cotton yarn, finished fabrics
including embroidery fabrics, bed linen, terry towels and
polyester yarn. At peak level of operations, the Company
was exporting its products to over 90 countries.
Alok has uniquely positioned itself in the cotton and
polyester product streams. While in polyester there
is manufacturing of partially oriented yarn (POY),
texturised yarn (DTY), fully drawn yarn (FDY) and
polyester staple fiber (PSF), on the cotton side there is
complete vertical integration from cotton spinning to
manufacturing of apparel fabrics, home textiles and
garments. While each of these business divisions are like
independent value generating entities, the focus is on
offering a comprehensive product suite to cater to the
ever demanding needs of customers .

Financial Performance (Stand Alone)
During the current financial year also Company’s sales
continued to decline and it made losses. The main
reason for losses were provisions / write off of debtors,
provisions for impairment in investment and loans
given to wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company and
finance cost.
The reason for provisioning and write off of debtors is
that over the last 4-5 years, manufacturing operations of
the Company started coming down and reached about
30% capacity utilisation level. As a measure to counter
the drop in sales, the Company increased the trading
business in the domestic un-organised market. But due
to the tight market situation, this market got affected
adversely leading to defaults in payments, a build-up
of debtors and elongation of the receivables cycle. The
rotational cycle in the market started to disrupt and
payments stopped against even the fresh supplies. Many
of these parties from the un-organised market were
small and fragmented traders who could not withstand
the tight market conditions and closed their operations.
The Company, in accordance with the Generally Accepted
Accounting Policies and Standards, made a complete
provision for doubtful debts and wrote off debtors
where required. Looking at the deteriorating situation
in the un-organised market and recovery issues, the
trading business was discontinued from July 2017.
The stand-alone results give the analysis of the textile
business of the Company. Table 2 gives the summarised
profit and loss statement of the Company in the current
year compared to the previous year.

Subsidiaries - Textiles
Mileta
Through its step down subsidiary Alok Industries
International Limited, Alok has a 100% stake in

Subsidiaries
UK Retail: Store Twenty One
Alok held a 99.87% equity in Grabal Alok (UK) Ltd (Grabal
(UK), a Company that used to operate the ‘Store Twenty
One’ chain of value-format stores in UK, through its step
down subsidiary Alok Industries International Limited
and Grabal Alok International Limited.
The Company was continuously making losses and during
the period under review it underwent restructuring by
way of Creditors Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) and also
stores which were making losses were closed down.
However, the CVA scheme could not be implemented
due to scarcity of funds and finally Grabal Alok UK was
taken under liquidation on 10th July 2017. The process
of liquidation is on presently. Considering this, the
Company has made full provision of the investment /
advances given to the said subsidiary.
Real Estate: Alok Infrastructure Limited
The Company had made investments in the realty
sector through its 100% subsidiary Alok Infrastructure
Limited. The plan was to create value and monetise
the same at the right opportunity. However, depressed
market conditions in the real estate space resulted in:
(i) the Company having to dispose off some of its assets
at losses and (ii) restricting the Company’s ability to
monetise the land bank at Silvassa. The Company has
sold its investment in two joint ventures (held through
Alok Infrastructure Limited) in the course of the financial
year ending 31st March 2018. The Company has also
provided for the loans / advances to the extent not
recoverable from its subsidiaries.
The performance of all of subsidiaries and step down
subsidiaries are given in table 10.

Sustainable Business Practices and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
Alok has always striven to be a leader in sustainable integrated, textile solutions delivering value through
environmentally and socially responsible textile products. In addition to its commitments towards quality and health,
safety and environment there are certain specific initiatives that related to sustainability and social development.

Ethical Fibre
At the first stage of its value chain is procurement of
cotton, which is the Company’s predominant fibre
utilisation. Increasingly, the world is witnessing the
promotion of ethical fibres like
• Organic cotton, which is cotton grown without the use
of external synthetic agricultural inputs like fertilizers
and pesticides and helps conserve the environment
from the harmful effects of the use of hazardous agro
chemicals
• Fair Trade cotton fibre
• Better Cotton, which involves educating the cotton
growers to adopt the Best Management Practices in
cotton cultivation for more sustainable yields
• Recycled cotton and polyester for spinning plant.
A shift from conventional fibre use to these ethical
variants significantly reduces the environmental impact
of growing conventional, resource intensive cotton
and help marginal cotton growers economize on farm
expenses.
Alok has led from the forefront amongst Indian
companies adopting use of such fibres. The Company is
GOTS certified and a member of Better Cotton Initiative
(BCI) quality manufacturer supplying Organic and Better
Cotton textile products to the world’s leading brands
in Europe and the US. As a Fair Trade (FLO) certified
Company, Alok values the fair price concept across the
value chain. The Company has been instrumental in a
few of the well-known Organic and Fair Trade cotton
projects in India and abroad.
Similarly, Cotton made in Africa (CMiA) is another
important variant of sustainable cotton which Alok can
use based on the specific requirements of its customers.
Sustainable Manufacturing
In addition, Alok remains committed to sustainable
manufacturing operations, which also implies use of
newer and cleaner technology, use of eco-friendly dyes
for all processing, treatment of post-dyeing effluents,
installation of reverse osmosis (RO) units to recover fresh
water from the treated one and installation of Selective
Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems in the exhaust of the
DG sets to reduce oxides of Nitrogen.
The Company encourages the use of recycled products
and has set up a recycled polyester unit with an initial 20
tons/ day of capacity to recycle polyester and polyester
yarn waste, flakes and PET bottles to produce 100%
recycled polyester fibre.
Social Development
In the previous years, Alok had been regularly working
on improving the quality of life in communities where
it operates by adopting measures that benefit the local
population in terms of direct and indirect employment.
In the process, the Company has also played an active
role on providing training and employment to local tribal
women.
Alok had also given its support in establishing a school -
Alok Public School - in Silvassa, which now has a student
base of close to 750 and is a much coveted school in
the township and surrounding areas. The School has
been granted the esteemed CBSE affiliation and also
recognized as a ‘New Generation’ CBSE school for its
innovative methods and practices.
However due to paucity of funds, the Company has not
been able to spend any amount during the year on its
social development activities.
Risks & Risk Mitigation
This section contains the Company’s view on risk and the
critical risk factors for the Company. This section also
provides the manner in which the Company manages
risk through its risk management processes.
Raw Material
The Company’s operations and profitability are
significantly dependent on the timely availability and
price of raw materials used in production process. The
primary raw materials for textile operations are cotton
and PTA & MEG. The Company also buys cotton yarn,
polyester yarn and fabrics of specifications required by
customers but are not produced in its plants.
Being an agricultural commodity, prices of cotton are
affected by a range of factors like changes weather
conditions affecting sowing, government policies
and regulations. Governing taxes, tariffs, duties,
subsidies, import and export restrictions on agricultural
commodities and commodity products, etc. All of these
influence pricing and demand- supply situation in this
industry. The planting of certain crops versus other uses
of agricultural resources, the location and size of crop
production, volume and types of imports and exports,
etc. determine availability of cotton. As the tables 11
and 12 below show cotton prices during 2017-18, after
some reduction, stabilised and are moving in an upward
directions in the last few months.",9254,0.7307276690049268,"['risk management', 'global economy']",False

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND PERFORMANCE REVIEW
During the fiscal 2014-15, the turnover of the Company increased to Rs. 3,205.52 Lakhs as compared to Rs. 2,638.57 Lakhs in the previous
year. However due to sluggish market, increase in labour, power and other operational costs , and financial constraints , Company could not
optimally utilize its capacities and its lossess increased to Rs. 2,411.71 Lakhs as compared to Rs. 962.02 Lakhs in the previous year.
Further, over the period the company has eroded its net worth completely and it has been declared as a Sick Company under Sick Industrial
Companies (Special Provisions) Act'1985 by the Board for industrial and financial restructuring (BIFR) vide its order dated 18th July'2012.
Management Discussion and Analysis
Indian Textile Industry is one of the leading textile Industries in the world. The textile sector has always been an important part of people's
lives in India. The textile sector is highly diverse and has hand-spun and hand woven segments at one end of the spectrum, and capital-
intensive, sophisticated and modern mills at the other. India's Textile Industry is largely dependent on textile manufacturing and export and
India earns about 17% of its foreign exchange through Indian textile exports. The Indian Textile Industry also contributes 5% of the GDP and
employs more than 35 million people, the second largest employment only after agriculture, and 14% of the industrial production of the
country.
However, for Amit Spinning the last fiscal was very difficult and challenging mainly due to sluggish market demand and rapid & significant
increase in labour, power and other operating costs and shortage of working capital .which lead to fall in EBITDA levels.
M/s Amit Spinning Industries Limited has already been declared as a Sick Company under SICA by BIFR and the UCO Bank has been
appointed as the Operating Agency. However, with an attempt to safeguard the interests of the stakeholders particularly employees, unit has
been engaged in carrying out under job work.
Management is confident that once the rehabilitation scheme is approved by the BIFR, Company will turn around and recover from the
current difficult phase and accordingly it is in process of reviewing its strategic plans and looking at means to find a way to increase its
turnover, reduce its costs and achieve a higher value addition so that it could achieve positive result in the near future.
Segment-Wise Performance
Amit Spinning Industries Ltd. (ASIL) being a cotton yarn manufacturer has only one business segment. On the basis of geographical
categorization of market, ASIL identified two segments i.e. exports and domestic.
During the year under review, Company has manufactured 1281.64 MT of yarn on its own resources and 1112.65 MT of yarn on job work
basis.
Subsidiary Companies
As there are no subsidiaries/ associates / joint ventures of the Company, the provisions contained in Companies Act, 2013/Listing
Agreements relating to subsidiaries are not applicable.
Share Capital
The Company's issued and paid up capital as on 31st March, 2015 stands at Rs. 20,58,48,335/- divided into 4,11,69,667 fully paid up equity
shares of Rs. 5/- each. During the year, under review, the Company has not issued any share(s). Further the Company has not issued any
share with differential Voting Rights/Sweat Equity shares/under Stock Option Scheme (ESOS) earlier and during the year.
The Company has no scheme of provision of money for purchase of its own shares by employees or by trustees for the benefit of employees.
Hence the details under rule 16 (4) of Companies (Share Capital and Debentures) Rules, 2014 are not required to be disclosed.
Management Perception On Opportunities, Risks, Concern & Outlook
The potential size of the Indian textile industry is expected to reach US$220 billion by 2020. Government has allowed 100% FDI in the Indian
textiles sector under the automatic route. Further, the Government has proposed the establishment of Centres of Excellence for training the
workforce in the textile sector and also to establish institutes under the public-private partnership (PPP) model to encourage private sector
participation in the development of the industry. However due to change in China policy, Indian exports have been affected and showed
down by 50% in the graph of financial year 2014-15, but could recover partially in the year 2015-16 to 1.2 million tones.
Further, Government has approved a debt restructuring package to help loss making textile mills to be administered on case by case basis
by the banks within the prudential norms of the Reserve Bank of India. Also, BIFR has decided on reliefs / concessions etc. to be given to
units / companies on the revival packages which will prove to be beneficial for Amit Spinning Industries Limited, as well.
Further, with focus on Make in India, the Indian Textile industry is expected to become resilient and robust through various support measures
likely to be announced by the government. The future outlook for the Indian Textile Industry looks promising, buoyed by both strong domestic
consumption and increase in export turnover.

Slow but potentially promising increase in demand of cotton yarn in domestic market and talk of economic reforms by the new government
as well as encouraging export promotion policy for textile sector have already improved market sentiments to some extent. With the awaited
approval of rehabilitation scheme by BIFR and with the continued support and co-operation of company's bankers, management believes
that your Company would again initiate its own production, optimally utilize capacities, increase sales volumes, and consequently margins
are also expected to be strengthened in due course.

position to pay the same only after infusion of funds pursuant and subsequent to the approval of Rehabilitation Scheme.
CONCLUSION
Your company is presently going through challenging and difficult period due to market and financial constraints. It has already been
declared as a Sick Company under Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985 by BIFR vide its order dated 18th
July'2012, and UCO Bank has been appointed as an Operating Agency to work out DRS for the Company in consultation with lenders.
It is however expected, on Company receiving BIFR approval for its DRS, it would be in a better position to augment its production and
sales, by utilizing its capacities optimally. UCO Bank has assigned its debt to JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Company Pvt. Ltd.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS REPORT
1.
GLOBAL ECONOMIC OVERVIEW
The global economic recovery continued to be weighed down in FY2016 by weak aggregate demand, falling commodity
prices (in particular crude oil), sharper than expected slowdown in the Chinese economy and increasing financial market
volatility in some of the major economies. These developments, coupled with sluggishness in many of the emerging and
developing markets, which constitute more than 70% of the global economy, offset the slight recovery in the developed
economies. World GDP growth slowed to 2.4% in CY2015. Emerging Market and Developing Economies grew at 3.4%, while
the US and the Euro Area grew at 2.4% and 1.6%, respectively. Japan grew at 0.6%.
According to the World Bank, Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs) are facing stronger headwinds,
including weaker growth among advanced economies and low commodity prices. Significant divergences persist between
commodity exporters struggling to adjust to depressed prices and commodity importers showing continued resilience. In
addition, UK’s impending exit from the European Union, as a consequence of the Brexit referendum, has also presented
a cause of concern for the global economy. The World Bank revised its world GDP growth forecast for 2016 down to 2.4%,
0.5 percentage points below the January 2016 forecast. The 2017 GDP forecast stands at 2.8%.
Global growth is projected to pick up to 3% by 2018, as stabilizing commodity prices provide support to commodity exporting
EMDEs. Downside risks have become more pronounced. These include deteriorating conditions among key commodity
exporters, softer-than-expected activity in advanced economies, rising private sector debt in some large emerging markets,
and heightened policy and geopolitical uncertainties.
2.
INDIAN ECONOMIC OVERVIEW
Amidst a challenging global growth scenario and after a prolonged slowdown, the Indian economy recovered slightly and
grew 7.6% in FY2016, compared to 7.2% in FY2015. This was led by strong domestic demand and supported by several
policy initiatives of the Government of India, a low current account deficit, low inflation levels and adherence to fiscal
prudence. Furthermore, the current account deficit declined and foreign exchange reserves rose to US$351.5 billion in early
February 2016, and are well above standard norms for reserve adequacy. FDI to India has surged 37% since the launch
of the ‘Make in India’ campaign in October 2014 to February 2016.
However, the economy is still suffering from sluggishness in rural demand, caused by deficient monsoons for two years.
Moreover, despite five interest rate cuts since 2015, credit growth to the corporate sector remains subdued because of
stressed asset quality in the banking sector. Weak exports also weigh on growth: February marked the 15th consecutive
month of decline. World Bank has forecasted the GDP growth of India at 7.6% for 2016 and 7.7% for 2017.
According to one of India’s leading research and credit rating firms, the medium-term outlook will be shaped by progress
on initiatives such as reforms in banking and successful implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). Other key
factors crucial to sustaining growth include physical infrastructure issues such as seamless availability of electricity, creation
of road network and social aspects like health and education.

AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY
3.1 Global Automobile Industry
During FY2016, the performance of the global automotive industry remained region specific. Passenger car registrations
in Europe marked their 31st consecutive month of growth in March 2016 indicating continued strength of the consumer
sentiment in Europe. In the month of March, new car registrations in the EU reached more than 1.7 million units, which
is close to March 2007 levels, just before the economic crisis started to impact the automotive industry. However, pressures
over regulation and uncertainty over outlook still weigh on the industry.
In the United States, favourable economic conditions continued to provide support to the automotive industry. Total light
vehicle production grew 3.7% y-o-y over the six months ended March 2016. However, rising discounts and increasingly
favourable loan terms have started to raise concerns that automobile sales may have peaked.
Brazil’s domestic passenger car sales remained subdued owing to high inflation, credit constraints and low consumer
confidence. However, exports of Brazil made cars remain strong.
In Japan, continued erosion of purchasing power has hampered domestic automotive demand. Production has also been
affected due to lower demand from Indonesia. However, exports to US and Europe remain relatively strong, despite the
recent appreciation in Yen.
Thailand’s automotive industry is primarily export oriented. Despite a slow global recovery, export demand for Thailand
made automobiles remained strong.

The Indian automotive industry is one of the most attractive in the world and has witnessed growing interest from
international OEMs over the last many years. The industry had been impacted by a slowdown for a couple of years before
signs of a recovery in some of the automotive segments started to emerge in FY2016. However, this recovery has been
slow and fragmented.
Concerns around the new infrastructure ‘cess’ (tax) on automobiles and slowness in the rural economy continued to hamper
growth of the Passenger Vehicle segment in India. SIAM has cut its FY2017 growth outlook for the PV segment to 6-8%
from 11-12% earlier.
Medium and Heavy Commercial Vehicles (M&HCV) production has grown in FY2016 in anticipation of stronger economic
activity, although off the low base of last year. Light Commercial Vehicle production rose on the back of greater availability
of load from the consumer goods industry and expectations of good monsoons. SIAM has forecasted a 12-15% growth for
the M&HCV segment in FY2017.
Demand from the rural market has remained low for the 2-Wheelers segment. However, higher sales to customers in the
urban markets has offset some of the negative sentiment in the rural market. SIAM has a positive outlook on the sector
for FY2017 and expects a 0-3% and 17-19% growth in Motorcycle and Scooter segments, respectively.

AUTOMOTIVE COMPONENTS INDUSTRY
Over the last decade, the Indian automotive components industry has grown tremendously. This has been especially due
to increasing investments by automotive OEMs in India in turn leading to demand for technologically advanced components.
The growing scale has enabled manufacturers to keep costs low, further increasing the attractiveness of sourcing automotive
parts from India.
After witnessing a slowdown in the last few years, the Indian auto component industry registered better growth in FY2016.
The industry turnover for FY2016 stood at Rs. 2,556 billion compared to Rs. 2,348 billion in FY2015, a growth of 8.8%.
However, given the fragmented performance of the global automotive industry, Indian automotive component exports grew
by only 3.5%.
A key challenge faced by the Indian automotive components industry is the current duty structure that makes the cost of
raw materials higher in India than anywhere else. Necessary reforms in this regard will further support the government’s
‘Make in India’ campaign.
Given the dependence of the Indian automotive components industry on the performance of international automotive
markets, a more meaningful and broad based recovery in the global demand for automobiles would be needed to support
the Indian automotive components industry.

ANNUAL REPORT 2015-16 | 67
According to the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (ACMA), the Indian auto-components industry
is expected to register a turnover of US$100 billion by 2020 backed by strong exports ranging between US$80-100 billion
by 2026, from the current US$11.2 billion. A major contributor to this growth is expected to be the government’s Automotive
Mission Plan 2016-26, which will drive the ‘Make in India’ campaign. The plan will place a special focus on exports of
small cars, multi-utility vehicles (MUVs), two and three wheelers and automotive components.
The passage of the GST Bill is a significant development as it is expected to impact favourably, the economy in general
and the demand for automobiles, in particular. The automotive sector will gain by the lowering of taxes and, therefore, the
final consumer prices. This is likely to add to the growth momentum in the sector in the medium to long term.
5.
AMTEK AUTO: STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK
In the last few years, several macro headwinds have obstructed the growth of the automotive components industry
including flagging vehicle sales, increasing capital costs and slowing investments in manufacturing. This slowdown, which
still continues to impact the Indian automobile industry, has undermined our capacity expansions and utilizations, and
impacted profitability through FY2016. The momentum in our new order wins has also been affected, in line with the overall
demand scenario. The recent downgrade in industry forecasts by the automobile industry association lends veracity to this
slowdown.
Last year, for the first time in its rich 30 year history, Amtek Auto was faced with a cash flow mis-match owing to this
slowdown. To counter this situation, the senior management team outlined a three pronged strategy. Firstly, the Company
embarked on a Debt Realignment Program with its lenders. Significant progress has been made on this front with the
support of our financial institution partners. Secondly, Amtek Auto formulated a Deleveraging Plan based on monetization
of an international asset and certain non-core assets. This strategy is based on realising the significant equity value created
in these assets for the purpose of reducing the debt in the Indian operations. The plan is progressing in line with
management expectations. Thirdly, the management has also taken a highly strategic decision to bring a new investor on
board and use the investment in further reducing debt. Discussions with potential investors have been very encouraging
and we are confident of bringing this plan to fruition in the new future. The senior management team remains fully
committed to the overall deleveraging plan which will not only enhance our free cash flows resulting from lower interest
payments, but will also optimise Amtek Auto’s capital structure and create significant shareholder value.
The Amtek Business Excellence Program, which we started in 2014, has facilitated a highly successful implementation of
lean manufacturing processes. It remains the driving force behind Amtek Auto’s cost controls and productivity initiatives,
and is a key attribute of the Company’s business strategy. Amtek Auto has also taken up certain other strategic initiatives
such as realigning the product mix and expanding the product range to increase the share of our value added product
offering. Other initiatives centre around overall fiscal control, quality improvement, up-gradation in technology and research
& development. The Company also continues to focus on cost reduction and rightsizing initiatives. We are confident that
these initiatives, in particular the new set of products that are being developed, will help make Amtek Auto much more
competitive in the market place.
A key driver of Amtek Auto’s growth has been the expansion of global OEMs in India. This trend has already started to
receive a greater push from the Government’s ‘Make in India’ campaign. Global OEMs are expected to not only increase
investments into India, leading to higher car production levels, but also consolidate their suppliers who can achieve their
operational and quality targets. This will lead to increasingly more opportunities being presented to larger suppliers such
as Amtek Auto. In addition, we view the passage of the GST Bill as a positive development which would not only lead
to better affordability of automobiles for the masses and in turn translate into higher sales of automotive components, but
also bring in operational efficiencies.
Being ready to capitalise on the opportunities arising from these developments calls for a highly strategic way forward.
We are working to take the integration between our Indian and international operations to the next level, which will facilitate
not only revenue synergies, cost savings and engineering process improvements but also sharing of best practices to
achieve overall quality targets. Furthermore, we are actively looking to acquire new customers for many of our key products
that have already been widely accepted in the global marketplace. This will allow us to realise our objective of increasing
utilisations of the world class capacities that we have built and increase exports out of India, which offer the biggest cost
advantage to us.
Amtek Auto’s global manufacturing capacities, geographic market reach and blue chip customer base have made us one
of the world’s most dynamic companies in the engineered components sector. Our customers around the world acknowledge

68 | AMTEK AUTO LIMITED
the level of engineering in our manufacturing processes, the technological advancement of our products and for the highest
standards we have set in customer service. The relationships with these OEM and Tier 1 customers, which have been
reinforced time and again, will continue to help us compete at the highest levels in the global market place.

OPPORTUNITIES & STRENGTHS
Positive Outlook for the Global Automotive Industry: Strong economic growth and employment levels are expected to
help the US market to cross 18 million units over the next two years. Low European interest rates and government incentives
are likely to help maintain the sales momentum across many of the key European markets. China’s initiative to reduce
sales tax for passenger vehicles is expected to continue to bode well for production volumes in the near term. With a strong
momentum in key international automotive markets and an impending recovery in the Indian automotive industry, Amtek
Auto is in a position to ramp up utilisations and capture a significant share of this additional demand.
Strong Growth Prospects for the Global Forging Industry: According to a recent research by Technavio, the global forging
market during 2016-2020 is set to grow at a CAGR of around 8%. Characteristics associated with forged parts such as
reliability, strength, and economic viability have helped increase the use of forging over the years. The industry will continue
to witness growing demand both from automotive and non-automotive sectors.
Inherent Strengths of Manufacturing in India: Cost efficient labour, government support and availability of skilled
manpower have make India an attractive manufacturing destination over the years. This has resulted in increased interest
from various global OEMs in the form of tie-ups with local suppliers. As a result, many global OEMs have also managed
to achieve a fairly high level of localization in India. This continuing trend is expected to open significant opportunities for
the Indian component makers to supply to these players for their Indian and international demand.
In addition, total automotive component exports out of India are expected to continue to increase in the years to come.
India’s proximity to emerging markets such as South East Asia and Africa is a key advantage for developing an export base.
Furthermore, shipments to Europe from India are more cost effective as compared to those from Brazil and Thailand.
‘Make in India’: The Indian government’s focus on improving ease of business with its ‘Make in India’ initiative is expected
to soften regulations and reduce complex procedures. The initiative will also result in making India an even more cost
effective manufacturing destination.
The Government of India has taken a series of steps to support this program such as:
●
New Trade Policy: Export and import taxes on small volumes of goods have been abolished, and incentives
have been introduced for export-oriented units and export processing zones.
●
New Labor Laws: Theses include a “single window” labor compliance process for companies, simpler
Provident Fund (compulsory employee insurance and pension) procedures and a new inspection scheme.
●
Simplification of Regulatory Compliance: In an effort to enhance the ease of doing business, it has been
made possible for companies to obtain environmental approvals and licenses online.
The Indian Government’s Automotive Mission Plan 2016-26, the key driver of the ‘Make in India’ campaign envisages four-
fold growth in automotive volumes by FY2026. The Indian auto sector has the potential to generate up to US$300 billion
in annual revenues by FY2026, create around 65 million additional jobs and contribute more than 12% to India’s GDP,
according to the plan prepared jointly by SIAM and the Government of India.
Focus on Import Substitution to Drive Growth in the Non-automotive Sector: With the government of India’s emphasis
on substitution of imported goods to reduce import bills, sectors such as railways and defence are expected to look to Indian
companies for procurement. This provides manufacturing companies an opportunity to grow in the non-automotive
business.
7.
RISK AND CONCERNS
Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Amtek Auto’s operations are spread across many different regions. In the six month financial
year 2016, international business contributed 76.9% to the revenues. Due to the global nature of Amtek Auto’s business,
its operations are directly dependent on the general economic conditions across all key global markets. In the recent past,
global economic growth has remained volatile and uneven with several key markets facing economic challenges. The
Company, on a regular basis, assesses and evaluates the macroeconomic performance in its key markets and takes
suitable remedial actions as may be necessary from time to time to mitigate such risks.

ANNUAL REPORT 2015-16 | 69
Changes in Tax, Tariffs or Fiscal Policies: Imposition of additional taxes and levies designed to limit the use of automobiles
could adversely affect demand for the Company’s products. Changes in corporate and other taxation policies, as well as
changes in export and other incentives granted by various governments, or import or tariff policies, could also adversely
affect the Company’s financial results.
We are in the process of evaluating thoroughly the impact of the implementation of GST on our business.
Geopolitical and other Risks: Political instability, wars, terrorism, multinational conflicts, natural disasters, fuel shortages
and their prices, epidemics, labour strikes all present business risks. To counter these risks, the Company continues to
expand its geographic presence across all major automotive economies in the world.
Country Risk through Exports: Products produced by Amtek Auto are exported to a number of different automobile markets
globally. This exposes the Company to various risks associated with international business transactions. These include
various geopolitical risks, currency price regulatory risks and other such concerns.
Raw Material Prices: Prices and availability of various raw materials such as steel, non-ferrous, precious metals, rubber
and petroleum products are dependent on various environmental factors. Even as the Company continues to pursue cost
control measures, any unforeseen or sudden spike in cost of these items could impact the profitability of the Company
to the extent that customer price pass through terms are not available. For Amtek Auto, increase in the price of raw
materials, especially steel, are passed through so there is a limited impact on our profitability.
Global Competition: With the integration of global automobile supply chains, the automobile components industry has
become increasingly competitive with OEMs continuously scanning the market for lower prices and better terms. Even as
the Company enjoys strong and long standing relationship with many global OEMs, it continues to invest in newer products
and better quality control.
Financial Risk: Any change in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices can potentially impact the
financial performance of the Company.
Technological Changes: The business environment is evolving at a rapid pace. The changing technologies have led to
a shortening of the life cycle of new vehicles. Additional challenges include supply constraints from Tier II suppliers,
sustenance of operating cost efficiency gains and capacity expansions in the context of rapidly changing consumer demand
preferences. The Company continues to invest in new technologies and capacities to address such risks. In addition, our
focus on rationalization both in terms of size and functions, enables us to continue to complement the manufacturing
excellence programs that are being developed.
Risk Management: Strategic, operating and financial business risks are reviewed by the Risk Management Committee on
a regular basis. In addition to the above risks, the committee monitors any potential new risks that may arise due to changes
in the external environment. While the possibility of a negative impact due to one or more of such risks cannot be totally
avoided, the Company proactively takes reasonable steps to pre-empt and mitigate these.
8.
INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS AND THEIR ADEQUACY
The Company has an elaborate internal control system which monitors compliance to internal processes. It ensures that
all transactions are authorised, recorded and reported correctly. The systems are routinely tested and certified by Statutory
as well as Internal Auditors and cover all offices, plant facilities and key areas of business. The Internal Auditors
independently evaluate the adequacy of internal controls and concurrently audit the majority of the transactions in value
terms.
To further strengthen the internal control process, the Risk Management Committee has documented control procedures
covering all aspects of key financial and operating functions. The Company’s internal control systems provide for:
●
Adherence to applicable accounting standards and policies
●
Accurate recording of transactions with internal checks, prompt reporting and timely action
●
Compliance with applicable statues, policies, listing requirements and management policies and procedures
●
Review of capital investments and long term business plans
●
Periodic review meetings to guide optimum utilization of resources
●
Effective use of resources and safeguarding of assets

70 | AMTEK AUTO LIMITED
The Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness of internal control systems, and also provides timely updates on operating
effectiveness and controls to senior management team. A CEO and CFO Certificate, forming part of the Corporate Governance
Report, confirms the existence and effectiveness of internal controls and reiterates their responsibilities to report deficiencies
to the Audit Committee and rectify the same.
Our auditors carry out periodic audits as per an agreed internal audit programme. They bring to the notice of management,
issues which require their attention and also highlight the severity of the issue. Corrective actions are then set in place.
The internal auditors report is reviewed by the Audit Committee and placed before the Board of Directors for their
consideration.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS REPORT
1.
GLOBAL ECONOMIC OVERVIEW
The global macroeconomic landscape in FY2017 was uncertain, and was characterized by weak growth. Lacklustre
performance in the beginning of the year was partially offset by improved momentum towards the end of 2016. Important
global developments during the year included the US Federal Reserve increasing policy rates, partial recovery in global
commodity prices and a revival in global trade flows. Developed economies witnessed tepid growth in 2016, in continuum
with the trend of the past few years. At the other end of the spectrum, developing and emerging economies have gained
in stature and importance in the recent years. Although the growth patterns in emerging economies are uneven, we can
expect good growth in some of these economies at least for the medium term. And of course, the best performer in the
squad continues to be India.
Global growth is projected to accelerate to 2.7 percent this year and further strengthen to 2.9 percent in 2018-19, in line
with previous projections. However, the world economy continues to face a number of downside risks. They include
increased protectionism, heightened policy uncertainty, the possibility of financial market turbulence, and, over the longer
run, weaker potential growth. These risks highlight the urgency for policymakers in emerging market and developing
economies to rebuild macroeconomic policy space and implement policies that support investment and trade
Fig. 1 Global Economic Growth
World Bank – Global Economic Prospects (Fragile Recovery)
Global Economic activity gained some momentum in the second half of 2016, especially in advanced economies. Growth
picked up in the United States as firms grew more confident about future demand and inventories started contributing
positively to growth (after five quarters of drag). Growth also remained solid in the United Kingdom, where spending
proved resilient in the aftermath of the June 2016 referendum in favour of leaving the European Union (Brexit). Activity
surprised on the upside in Japan thanks to strong net exports, as well as in euro area countries, such as Germany and
Spain, as a result of strong domestic demand. Economic performance across emerging markets and developing economies
has remained mixed. Whereas China’s growth remained strong, reflecting continued policy support, activity has slowed
in India because of the impact of the currency exchange initiative, as well as in Brazil, which has been mired in a deep
recession. Activity remained weak in fuel and non-fuel commodity exporters more generally, while geopolitical factors
held back growth in parts of the Middle East and Turkey. World growth, estimated as in the October 2016 World Economic
Outlook at 3.1% in 2016, is projected to increase to 3.5% in 2017 and 3.6% in 2018 - an upward revision of 0.1 percentage
point for 2017 relative to October. Together with the modest change in the forecast for the overall global growth rate,
projections of the strength of economic activity across country groups have also shifted. Economic activity in advanced
economies as a group is now forecast to grow by 2.0% in 2017 and 2018, 0.2 percentage point higher than expected
in October 2016. Growth in the group of emerging market and developing economies is forecast to rise to 4.5% and 4.8%,
respectively, in 2017 and 2018, from an estimated outturn of 4.1% in 2016.

INDIAN ECONOMIC OVERVIEW
Domestic Economic activity has been losing momentum since second half of 2015-16 on a combination of structural and
cyclical factors. On a year-on-year basis, this trajectory was dented further by the transient impact of demonetisation. Both
private and government consumption demand have held up well against this slowdown, together accounting for 90%
of real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in second half of 2016-17 on a weighted contribution basis. Investment
demand, which had sunk into contraction in first-half, recovered from third quarter of 2016- 17. Net exports have been
growing strongly since third quarter of 2015-16. The same however turned negative with imports starting to expand at
a higher pace than exports as domestic demand strengthened. Headline inflation fell off its July cliff and was already
traversing a declining trajectory during August to October when demonetisation hit in November. This took inflation down
to 3.2%, the lowest in the history of India. In February, however, the drag from these transitory effects began to ebb and
headline inflation edged up on a pickup in food and fuel price pressures. With the effects of demonetisation turning out
to be short-lived and modest, discretionary consumer spending held back by demonetisation is expected to have picked
up from Q4:2016-17 and will gather momentum over several quarters ahead. The recovery will also likely be aided by
the reduction in banks’ lending rates due to large inflows of current and savings accounts (“CASA”) deposits, although
the fuller transmission impact might be impeded by stressed balance sheets of banks and the tepid demand for bank
credit. The ebullient rebound in agricultural activity on the back of normal monsoon and record foodgrains production have
boosted rural incomes and supported consumption. In contrast, the modest pick-up in industry in second half of 2016-
17 and the slower growth in services suggests that investment demand is still sluggish.
Indian economy successfully navigated through the external global turbulence and the temporary negative impact of
demonetization to register a growth of 7.1% in FY 2017. According to the Economic Survey 2016–17, India’s real GDP growth
is projected at 7.1% for 2017, and could remain in the range of 6.75–7.5% in 2018. This posts India as one of the fastest
growing economies amidst an environment of global economic uncertainty. The decline in consumption due to
demonetization along with slowdown in the industrial sector resulted in moderated growth rate towards the end of 2017.
However, the agriculture sector showcased enhanced performance, owing to a favourable monsoon after two consecutive
droughts.
Economic Survey: 2016-2017 Ministry of Finance
Against the backdrop of robust macro-economic stability, the year was marked by two major domestic policy developments,
the passage of the Constitutional amendment, paving the way for implementing the transformational Goods and Services
Tax (GST), and the action to demonetise the two highest denomination notes. The GST will create a common Indian market,
improve tax compliance and governance, and boost investment and growth; it is also a bold new experiment in the
governance of India’s cooperative federalism. Demonetisation has had short-term costs but holds the potential for
longterm benefits. Follow-up actions to minimize the costs and maximise the benefits include: fast, demand-driven,
remonetisation; further tax reforms, including bringing land and real estate into the GST, reducing tax rates and stamp
duties; and acting to allay anxieties about over-zealous tax administration. These actions would allow growth to return
to trend in 2017-18, following a temporary decline in 2016-17
Economic growth of around 7.2% makes India the fastest-growing G20 economy. The acceleration of structural reforms,
the move towards a rule-based policy framework and low commodity prices has provided a strong growth impetus.
Recent deregulation measures and efforts to improve the ease of doing business have boosted foreign investment.
According to Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), the total FDI investments India received during April
2016-March 2017 rose 8 per cent year-on-year to US$ 60.08 billion, indicating that government’s effort to improve ease
of doing business and relaxation in FDI norms is yielding results.
The foreign exchange reserves has reached an all time high to US$393 billion in August 2017 and is likely to cross US$400
billion by September. The pace of forex accretion has been the strongest since 2015 and this has also been one of the
strongest in Asia ex-Japan in the past 12 months.

AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY
3.1
Global Automotive Industry
Based on strong growth in production and sales of automobiles in the first quarter of 2017 in most of the key regions
around world, there is optimism that this year will see continued gains for the global automotive industry. The Western
European car market ended the first quarter up more than 7% on the same period in 2016, recording 3.9 million new
registrations. All of the five largest individual markets expanded, with Italy enjoying the strongest growth at 18%. Double

of which 3,791 million were cars.The focus is on tightening of emission norms internationally and in India, will translate
into higher quality transmission materials which should be light and at the same time handle high fatigue and tension.
Macro tailwinds of low inflation and low fuel prices which act as catalyst for fleet operators’ profitability, will push the
medium-term growth of the CV segment. This is further supported by the Government’s focus on infrastructure investment
and transition to BS-VI by 2020-21.
The Company considers human resources as its most important asset. It is the invaluable contribution of the Company’s
large and energetic team that has primarily resulted in strength in the industry. The Company has implemented various
initiatives to create a worker-friendly organization that motivates its employees and improves performance.
Growing the intellectual capital of its team is one of the Company’s leading people-centric priorities. For this the Company
has established an training calendar, behavioural, cultural, safety, 5S and awareness training which facilitates the team
in proficiently managing day-today operational challenges. Training for the senior management team is oriented towards
managing skills, decision-making, and problem-solving to ensure uninterrupted operations notwithstanding internal
challenges and external volatility. Pre and post training tests are conducted as a tool for evaluating effectiveness. This
has helped in strengthening the learning culture within the organization. Several initiatives were implemented to enhance
employee engagement and morale which includes suggestion scheme, cross functional competition and birthday
celebrations. The Company facilitates continuous engagement between the management and various teams. These
dialogues help in growing strategic and operational awareness, and enhancing efficiencies through idea-exchange.

Fig. 2 Automotive Production Trends

ANNUAL REPORT 2016-17 | 67
India is also a prominent auto exporter and has strong export growth expectations for the near future. In April-March 2017,
overall automobile exports grew by 1.91 per cent. PV, Commercial Vehicles, and Two Wheelers registered a growth of
9.17 per cent, 3.03 per cent, and 8.29 per cent respectively during first quarter of 2017. In addition, several initiatives by
the Government of India and the major automobile players in the Indian market are expected to make India a leader
in the Two Wheeler and Four Wheeler market in the world by 2020.
The government aims to develop India as a global manufacturing as well as a research and development (R&D) hub.
It has set up National Automotive Testing and R&D Infrastructure Project (NATRIP) centres as well as a National Automotive
Board to act as facilitator between the government and the industry.
Alternative fuel has the potential to provide for the country’s energy demand in the auto sector as the CNG distribution
network in India is expected to rise to 250 cities in 2018 from 125 cities in 2014. Also, the luxury car market could register
high growth and is expected to reach 150,000 units by 2020.
Fig. 3 Domestic Sales Trends
India is the world’s fourth largest energy consumer. The country’s oil consumption is expected to rise significantly over
the next decade to cater the demands of a growing economy. India plans to reduce its dependence on imports and
achieve at least a 10% reduction in energy imports by FY 2022. For this, it is increasing investments in oil and gas
exploration, developing discovered oil and gas reserves, enhancing production from existing fields, and tapping
unconventional resources like shale gas, etc. Oil exploration and production spend in the country has doubled in the last
5 years and the same is expected to be robust in the near future.

Market Size
Over the last decade, the automotive components industry has scaled three times to US$ 39 billion in 2015-16 while
exports have grown even faster to US$ 10.8 billion. This has been driven by strong growth in the domestic market and
increasing globalisation (including exports) of several Indian suppliers.
The Indian Auto Component industry is expected to grow by 8-10 per cent in FY 2017-18, based on higher localisation
by Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM), higher component content per vehicle, and rising exports from India, as per
ICRA Limited.
According to the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (ACMA), the Indian auto-components industry
is expected to register a turnover of US$ 100 billion by 2020 backed by strong exports ranging between US$ 80-US$ 100
billion by 2026, from the current US$ 11.2 billion.
The Government of India’s Automotive Mission Plan (AMP) 2006–2016 has come a long way in ensuring growth for the
sector. It is expected that this sector’s contribution to the GDP will reach US$ 145 billion in 2016 due to the government’s
special focus on exports of small cars, multi-utility vehicles (MUVs), two and three-wheelers and auto components.
Separately, the deregulation of FDI in this sector has also helped foreign companies to make large investments in India.
The Government of India’s Automotive Mission Plan (AMP) 2016–2026 envisages creation of an additional 50 million jobs
along with an ambitious target of increasing the value of the output of the sector to up to US$ 282.65 billion.
The Indian auto-components industry is set to become the third largest in the world by 2025. Indian auto-component
makers are well positioned to benefit from the globalisation of the sector as exports potential could be increased by up
to four times to US$ 40 billion by 2020 accounting for as much as 26 per cent of the market

edge technologies and innovations. The key strategy is on developing new processes, expanding the product portfolio
& product mix, and leveraging on our innovation capabilities to open more growth avenues.
The Company monitors its financial position regularly and optimises its cash resources through a robust cash management
system. However, despite this the Company is experiencing a stress on the cash flows with the result that during the
financial year 2016-17, the Company has been unable to meet all its debt obligations. The Company has had various
rounds of discussions with the lenders and is currently engaged in formulating a scheme for debt restructuring which
will be submitted to the lenders forum. In this regard the Company is co-ordinating with the lead lenders for sucessful
implementation of the proposed debt restructuring scheme, which will be submitted in due course, for approval to the
lenders forum. It is envisaged, that the Company, post sucessful implementation of the proposed debt restructuring
scheme, will emerge as a much stronger Company with an improved capital structure and poised for growth. The Reserve
Bank of India (RBI) on the recommendation of its Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), directed to Banks to invoke bankruptcy
proceedings against the Company under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS REPORT
1.
GLOBAL ECONOMIC OVERVIEW
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the global economy growth will inch up from 3.8% in CY17 to 3.9%
in 2018 and 2019 this is the highest rate of global GDP growth after CY11. The growth happened owing to an increase in
manufacturing activity, private consumption, investments and global trade. The US economy remained in robust shape, with
growth in GDP, industrial production, and investment holding up well. The US growth forecast has been raised from 2.3%
to 2.7% in 2018 and from 1.9% to 2.5% in 2019. In 2017, the euro zone turned in its fastest pace of growth over the last
decade. Emerging markets contributed to the uptick last year, and many are on track to turn in an even better growth
performance in 2018. China’s growth remained robust and well-balanced across sectors and across categories of domestic
demand.
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) corporate capital expenditure should become a more prominent growth
driver, inflation is unlikely to rise much, and central banks will reduce liquidity and raise interest rates in response to better
growth. Faster growth in the US, Japan, and China would largely drive global growth during 2019. An encouraging trade
and investment environment, along with easing financial conditions, would also impact the global economic conditions.
Other Global Developments
i.
Oil witnessed a sharp increase from the levels of $41 per barrel in 2016 to a four-year high at $54 per barrel in 2017,
driven by production cuts administered by OPEC.
ii.
US monetary measures – US Dollar appreciated on the back of rising Federal Reserve rates from 0.75-1% in March
iii.
Landmark tax reforms in the US, reducing tax rates from 35% to 21% to bolster investment and employment.

INDIAN ECONOMIC OVERVIEW
India has emerged as the fastest growing major economy in the world as per the Central Statistics Organization (CSO) and
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and it is expected to be one of the top three economic powers of the world over the
next 10-15 years, backed by its strong democracy and partnerships. India’s GDP is estimated to have increased 6.6 per
cent in 2017-18 and is expected to grow 7.3 per cent in 2018-19.
(AVERAGE GROWTH OF GDP DURING 2014-2017)

ANNUAL REPORT 2017-18 | 67
(Company under Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process)
The investment cycle exhibited a growth of 7.6% in FY18 and 14.4% in the Q-4’18. The FY18 is likely to see an improved
growth of 7.5% due to transformative reforms undertaken by the Government.
India’s economic fundamentals continued to improve during the year. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) touched 4.3%
during the FY18 after a robust growth of 6.2% in the Q-4’18, which was 1.9% in Q-1’18. Inflation figures are also largely
in control, with the Consumer Price Inflation reducing to 3.6% in FY18 from a level of 4.5% in FY17, keeping the food prices
under control. Through the year, India’s foreign exchange reserves have also increased to more than US$422 billion.
According to Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), the total FDI investments in India has increased to from
US$ 60 billion in 2016-17 to US$ 61.96 billion in 2017-18, indicating that government’s effort to improve ease of doing
business and relaxation in FDI norms is yielding results. The foreign exchange reserves crossed the US$400 billion mark
in September, 2017 and reached an all time high to US$424 billion in April 2018.
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) - constitution amendment bill, passed by the government, to be implemented from July
1st, 2017 will have a significant impact on the taxation structure in the country. The GST will create a common Indian market,
improve tax compliance and governance, and boost investment and growth; it is also a bold new experiment in the
governance of India’s cooperative federalism. The Goods and Services Tax (GST), reformed the system of indirect taxes by
streamlining payments and credit and improving the efficiency of movement of goods across the country. During the year,
the Government of India took various initiatives to improve the confidence in the Indian economy and boost its growth.
The 2018-19 Union Budget has emphasised on India’s infrastructural requirements and the allocation on roads railways
and rural infrastructure has been significant. The Budget also focused considerably on health and education sectors, which
are instrumental in developing a sustainable economy and society.
Make in India and Digital India. Mr. Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India, has launched the Make in India initiative
with an aim to boost the manufacturing sector of Indian economy, to increase the purchasing power of an average Indian
consumer, which would further boost demand, and hence spur development, in addition to benefiting investors. The
Government of India, under the Make in India initiative, is trying to give boost to the contribution made by the manufacturing
sector and aims to take it up to 25 per cent of the GDP from the current 17 per cent. Besides, the Government has also
come up with Digital India initiative, which focuses on three core components: creation of digital infrastructure, delivering
services digitally and to increase the digital literacy.

AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY
3.1 Global Automobile Industry
The worldwide automotive industry has been on its growth path for the eighth year in succession. In 2017 it added 3%
and come to 96.8 million motor vehicles which includes passenger cars, commercial vehicles and buses.
For 2018 forecast is that the global automotive market will increase by around 1%, reaching almost 98 million units. The
global passenger car market alone is also expected to add about 1%, to 86 million new vehicles in 2018. A look at the
situation in the individual regions reveals a range of different developments.
For the United States, the last quarter of 2017 has shown strong growth that could impact early 2018 industry sales, but
full-year sales volume in 2018 is expected to achieve 16.9 million units, down 1.7% from 2017. Demand remains healthy,
supported by positive economic conditions and welcoming credit conditions, but an incoming flow of used vehicles and
continued slowdown in passenger car sales as more consumers opt for utility vehicles are expected to lead to decline
for the second year in a row.
Western Europe continues to recover, aided by lingering pent-up demand in key recovery markets, however at a much
slower pace than last year. Some markets have OEM diesel incentives, which are expected to generate mild pulled-forward
demand of 16.3 million units in 2018, up about 0.7% from last year.
Factoring in tax payback effects, Chinese demand will post 28.1 million units, up 0.2 % from 2017, according to the forecast.
As in 2016, confirmation of 2018 vehicle tax levels will obviously have a bearing on the near-term outlook for the year.
The South Asian outlook has improved dramatically and should further recover in 2018 with an estimated rise in market
by 7.3% from 2017, with India accelerating after tax reforms moving up by 11%. The forecast also indicates a decent 2018
outlook for ASEAN car markets, estimating 7% growth over last year. Japan and South Korea remain similarly impacted
by regional geopolitical concerns and are expected to moderate in 2018—Japan slows 2.4 %, while Korea will likely grow
2%. Russia and Brazil turned the corner in 2017, and 2018 represents the sustainability test for both recoveries. Russia is

68 | AMTEK AUTO LIMITED
(Company under Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process)
expected to grow by 15.9%, helped by a stronger rouble and some recovery in oil prices, but sanctions remain a key
negative driver. Ongoing political troubles remain an issue, but Brazil is expected to see 12.5% growth for 2018, driven by
pent-up demand and improving auto-financing conditions.
3.2
Indian Automobile Industry
The automobile industry in India is world’s fourth largest, with the country currently being the world’s 4th largest manufacturer
of cars and 7th largest manufacturer of commercial vehicles in 2017. Indian automotive industry (including component
manufacturing) is expected to reach Rs 16.16-18.18 trillion (US$ 251.4-282.8 billion) by 2026. Two-wheelers dominate the
industry making up 81% share in the domestic automobile sales in 2017-18. Overall, Domestic automobiles sales increased
at 7.01% CAGR between FY13-18 with 24.97 million vehicles getting sold in 2017-18. Indian automobile industry has received
Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) worth US$ 18.76 billion between April 2000 and March 2018.
The passenger vehicle sales in India crossed the 3.2 million units in 2017-18, and is further expected to increase to 10
million units by 2020. Auto sales witnessed a year-on-year growth rate of 18.1% across segments, driven by a 19.91%
growth in passenger vehicle sales. Overall exports in 2018-19 are likely to increase to 26.73% year-on-year.
The government aims to develop India as a global manufacturing as well as a research and development (R&D) hub. It
has set up National Automotive Testing and R&D Infrastructure Project (NATRiP) centres as well as a National Automotive
Board to act as facilitator between the government and the industry. The Indian government has also set up an ambitious
target of having only electric vehicles being sold in the country.
Alternative fuel has the potential to provide for the country’s energy demand in the auto sector as the CNG distribution
network in India is expected to rise to 250 cities in 2018 from 125 cities in 2014. Also, the luxury car market could register
high growth and is expected to reach 150,000 units by 2020.

AUTOMOTIVE COMPONENTS INDUSTRY
The Indian auto-components market contributes almost 7% to India’s GDP and employs as many as 19 million people. The
auto components sector has been observing robust growth, and turnover is anticipated to reach US$ 200 billion by 2026
from US$ 43.5 billion in 2017. India’s exports of auto components could account for as much as 26% of the market by 2021.
Growth of the domestic auto components industry is expected to reach 13-15% in 2018 on the back of high growth
expectation in domestic passenger vehicles and two-wheelers segments.
Favourable government policies such as Auto Policy 2002, Automotive Mission Plan 2016-2026, National Automotive
Testing and R&D Infrastructure Projects (NATRIPs), have helped the Indian auto components industry achieve considerable
growth.
India is emerging as global hub for auto component sourcing. A cost-effective manufacturing base keeps costs lower by
10-25% relative to operations in other countries. Relative to competitors, India is geographically closer to key automotive
markets like the Middle East and Europe. Global auto component players are increasingly adopting a dual-shore
manufacturing model, using overseas facilities to manufacture few types of components and Indian facilities to manufacture

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS REPORT
1.
GLOBAL ECONOMIC OVERVIEW
The overall performance of the global economy remained subdued through 2014, as well as into 2015. The world
economy grew 3.4% in 2014, impacted by a slowdown in many developing countries, which account for approximately
75% of the world economy. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the global GDP growth rate is expected
to decline further by 30bps to 3.1% in 2015. A modest pickup in advanced economies and continued challenges in
emerging markets are the major factors behind these lower projections. The GDP growth for emerging markets and
developing countries in 2015 is expected to decline by 60bps to 4.0%, owing to weaker economic growth in the oil
exporting countries, a slowdown in China and expected negative growth in Brazil.
2.
INDIAN ECONOMIC OVERVIEW
During fiscal year 2015, the Indian economy started to show signs of a recovery after a prolonged slowdown. India’s GDP
registered a growth of 7.3% as compared to 6.8% in the previous year, supported by improved consumer and business
sentiment. This was evident in an improvement in Index of Industrial Production (IIP) by 2.8% in 2015 as compared to
a decline of 0.1% in 2014.
IIP rose 9.8% in October 2015 indicating an industrial recovery. However, the IIP growth of 3.6% in September 2015, the
slowest in 4 months, has raised concerns over the strength of the recovery. According to the World Bank, in the medium
term, the Indian economy is not immune to a slowdown in global demand and heightened volatility. China’s slowdown
has further deteriorated India’s already weak export outlook and that India requires more foreign capital inflows to
finance both fiscal and current account deficits and ultimately the investments to spur growth.

AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY
3.1 Global Automobile Industry
In some of the developed nations in North America and Europe, improved consumer confidence has led to a rebound
in automotive sales in 2015. North America is expected to register a growth of 6.3% in passenger car sales in 2015; the
growth forecast for Western Europe remains equally encouraging at 7.0%. However, the 12 months period ending
September 2015 has been a challenging phase for the global automotive industry as a whole. Automotive activity
continues to weaken in Brazil and Russia, owing to deteriorating economic conditions. Passenger car sales are expected
to decline 20.1% and 15.7% in eastern Europe and South America respectively. Concerns over a slowdown in China, a
major automotive market, have also impacted the automotive industry sentiment.

ANNUAL REPORT 2014-15 | 57
3.2
Indian Automobile Industry
The Indian automotive industry is one of the largest in the world with annual production of 23.5 million vehicles, with
more than 80% attributed to two and three wheelers. The industry accounts for about 7% of India’s GDP and is a key
indicator of the state of economic development in the country.
The industry has been impacted by a slowdown but in fiscal year 2016, signs of a recovery in some of the automotive
segments have started to emerge. However, this recovery is slow and fragmented. In the passenger car segment, sales
growth continued to be subdued, largely due to challenges in the rural economy. Although the medium & heavy
commercial vehicle sales started to pick up from a very low level, light commercial vehicle sales continued to decline
as a result of overcapacity and uncertainty about monsoons. The 2 Wheeler segment was impacted by sluggish sales
due to poor crop realisation and a low rise in wages in the rural markets. The pace of growth in the urban demand
for scooters has also declined in the recent months.
Note: Fiscal Year ending March
4.
INDIAN AUTOMOTIVE COMPONENTS INDUSTRY
Over the last decade, the Indian automotive components industry has grown tremendously. This has been especially due
to increasing investments by automotive OEMs in India in turn leading to demand for technologically advanced components.
The growing scale has enabled manufacturers to keep costs low, further increasing the attractiveness of sourcing
automotive parts from India.
However, in the last few years, several macro headwinds have obstructed the growth of the automotive components
industry including flagging vehicle sales, increasing capital costs, high interest rates and slowing investments in
manufacturing. From fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2015, the turnover of the automotive components industry declined
by 17%. This is consistent with a decline in production of automobiles across most segments over the period. The
production of two and three wheelers, commercial vehicles and tractors declined by 19%, 24% and 4% while the

58 | AMTEK AUTO LIMITED
production of passenger vehicles rose slightly by 3%. Subdued demand in the two wheeler, light commercial vehicle and
tractor industries in the first six months of fiscal year 2016 has put continued downward pressure on automotive
component sales.

Key Long Term Growth Drivers

Growth in the Automotive Sector: Despite the current flat trend in the Indian automotive industry, the long
term potential remains intact. India already offers one of the most cost effective manufacturing bases and
a high degree of technological advancement to global OEMs, which are expected to continue to increase
their investments in India.

ANNUAL REPORT 2014-15 | 59
Source: SIAM-ACMA-EY Vision 2020 Report (August 2010)

Exports: Not only does India offer a low cost manufacturing advantage, increasing investments in technology
have made India-made automotive components much more technologically advanced, resulting in growing
demand for these products. The substantial depreciation in the Indian Rupee over the last few years has
led to further cost advantages for manufacturing automotive parts in India. Besides the cost advantages,
growing exports help automotive components manufacturers in offsetting risk of local demand variation
and keeping overall costs competitive.
According to IBEF, the Indian automotive components industry is expected to register a turnover of US$ 115 billion by
FY2021 of which exports would be approximately US$30 billion. A major contributor to this growth is expected to be the
government’s Automotive Mission Plan 2016-26, which will drive its ‘Make in India’ campaign. The plan will place a
special focus on exports of small cars, multi-utility vehicles (MUVs), two and three wheelers and automotive components.
5.
AMTEK AUTO: STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK
Amtek Auto has always been a firm believer in the long term potential of the Indian automotive industry. Our capacity
expansions in India, along with those internationally, have underpinned our robust growth over the last decade. However,
in the last few years, several macro headwinds have obstructed the growth of the automotive components industry
including flagging vehicle sales, increasing capital costs, high interest rates and slowing investments in manufacturing.
This slowdown, which still continues to impact the domestic automobile industry, has undermined our capacity expansions
and utilizations, and impacted profitability in FY2015.
However, some of Amtek Auto’s customers are now expanding capacities anticipating higher demand in the quarters
to come. We expect the recovery to be stronger, driven by both a reforms led macro-economic recovery and increase
in the infrastructure spend. An infrastructural recovery will, in turn, lead to increased sales of commercial vehicles and
heavy equipment and machinery.
Another important catalyst for the domestic automotive industry, especially over the long term, is the Automotive Mission
Plan 2016-26, which will drive the government’s ‘Make in India’ campaign and has set a target of US $200 billion in
turnover for the Indian automotive component industry. This will translate to a growth of 3.5-4.0 times the current
industry size of approximately US $75 billion and place India among the top three automotive industries in the world.
The government’s ‘Make in India’ plan has already started to attract additional investments into the country. We believe
the much needed infrastructural push in India over the next 10 years will lead to increasingly more demand for commercial
vehicles.
A key driver of Amtek Auto’s growth is the expansion of global OEMs in India. Not only are they increasing investments
into the country leading to higher car production levels, but are also consolidating their suppliers who can achieve their
operational and quality targets. This trend is leading to a consolidation in the automotive ancillary industry with increasingly
more opportunities being presented to larger suppliers such as Amtek Auto. We have created additional capacities in
forging, aluminium casting and machining which position us well to cater to any increase in demand as the automotive
market recovers.

60 | AMTEK AUTO LIMITED
Looking ahead we expect to see increasing demand from our overseas subsidiaries for products which are manufactured
only at our India based facilities including for camshafts, crankshafts, cylinder blocks and cast turbo charger housing.
These cross selling opportunities are substantial and are expected to yield benefits in the near term. The acquisitions
overseas have the potential to generate orders through backward integration for the India manufacturing units. The new
acquisitions, in addition, will also provide Amtek Auto with access to state of the art technologies, growth markets, new
customers, and several strategic cross selling opportunities. A large percentage of their component purchases will be
targeted to be sourced from India. The OEMs are still importing a significant number of critical components such as cast
cylinder blocks, cylinder heads, front axle beams and steering knuckles. With India becoming more competitive in the
near future in terms of currency, local sourcing of such components has also started to grow.
Amtek Auto has also taken up certain other initiatives to increase its current level of sales and profitability by improving
and expanding the product mix, wider product range, quality improvement, up-gradation in technology, and research
& development. The Company also continues to focus on cost reduction and rightsizing initiatives, which are expected
to deliver results in the quarters to come. The Company’s planned multi-pronged market strategy not only focuses on
increasing the market share but also expanding the market size itself. We are confident that these initiatives, coupled
with the new set of products that are being developed, will help make Amtek Auto much more competitive in the market
place.
6.
OPPORTUNITIES & STRENGTHS
‘Make in India’: The Indian government’s focus on improving ease of business with its ‘Make in India’ initiative is
expected to soften regulations and reduce complex procedures. The initiative will also result in making India an even
more cost effective manufacturing destination.
Ramp up of Utilisations: The slowdown in the Indian automotive industry has resulted in a decline in capacity utilisation.
As the domestic market recovers and export demand continues to trend upwards, we will be in a position to ramp up
utilisations and capture a significant share of this additional demand.
Indian Manufacturing Advantages: Over the past few years, the Indian automobile market has benefitted from an
increased focus from various global OEMs who view India as their global manufacturing hub. Lower cost of labour,
government support and availability of skilled manpower makes India an attractive manufacturing destination. With
many OEMs establishing their facilities in India, it is expected to open significant opportunities for the Indian component
makers to supply to these players for their domestic and international demand.
Focus on Import Substitution: With the government of India’s emphasis on substitution of imported goods to reduce
import bills, sectors such as railways and defence are expected to look to Indian companies for procurement. This
provides manufacturing companies an opportunity to grow in the non-automotive business.
High Export Demand: With a focus on cost optimization, OEMs across the world have looked to cost effective countries
such as India, for sourcing automotive components and also setting up manufacturing bases for exports of automobiles.
This has led to an increase in India-made automotive component exports, both direct and indirect, as parts of an
exported automobile.
Total automotive component exports out of India are expected to continue to increase in the years to come. India’s
proximity to emerging markets such as South East Asia and Africa is a key advantage for developing an export base.
Furthermore, shipments to Europe from India are more cost effective as compared to those from Brazil and Thailand.
Simplifying Foreign Investment: The Government of India has permitted 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) in the
automotive industry through the automatic route. This has encouraged global OEMs to invest in and develop innovative
products, technologies and supply chains.
7.
RISK AND CONCERNS
Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Given the global nature of Amtek Auto’s business, its operations are directly dependent
on the general economic conditions, not only in India but across all key global markets. In the recent past, global
economic growth has remained volatile and uneven with several key markets facing economic challenges. The Company,
on a regular basis, assesses and evaluates the macroeconomic performance in its key markets and takes suitable
remedial actions as may be necessary from time to time to mitigate such risks.
Changes in Tax, Tariffs or Fiscal Policies: Imposition of additional taxes and levies designed to limit the use of automobiles

ANNUAL REPORT 2014-15 | 61
could adversely affect demand for the Company‘s products. Changes in corporate and other taxation policies, as well
as changes in export and other incentives granted by various governments, or import or tariff policies, could also
adversely affect the Company’s financial results.
Geopolitical and other Risks: Political instability, wars, terrorism, multinational conflicts, natural disasters, fuel shortages
and their prices, epidemics, labour strikes all present business risks. To counter these risks, the Company continues to
expand its geographic presence across all major automotive economies in the world.
Country Risk through Exports: Products produced by Amtek Auto are exported to a number of different automobile
markets globally. This exposes the Company to various risks associated with international business transactions. These
include various geopolitical risks, currency price regulatory risks and other such concerns.
Raw Material Prices: Prices and availability of various raw materials such as steel, non-ferrous, precious metals, rubber
and petroleum products are dependent on various environmental factors. Even as the Company continues to pursue cost
control measures, any unforeseen or sudden spike in cost of these items could impact the profitability of the Company
to the extent that customer price pass through terms are not available. For Amtek Auto, increase in the price of raw
materials, especially steel, are passed through so there is a limited impact on our profitability.
Global Competition: With the integration of global automobile supply chains, the automobile components industry has
become increasingly competitive with OEMs continuously scanning the market for lower prices and better terms. Even
as the Company enjoys strong and long standing relationship with many global OEMs, it continues to invest in newer
products and better quality control.
Financial Risk: Any change in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices can potentially impact the
financial performance of the Company.
Technological Changes: The business environment is evolving at a rapid pace. The changing technologies have led to
a shortening of the life cycle of new vehicles. Additional challenges include supply constraints from Tier II suppliers,
sustenance of operating cost efficiency gains and capacity expansions in the context of rapidly changing consumer
demand preferences. The Company continues to invest in new technologies and capacities to address such risks. In
addition, our focus on rationalization both in terms of size and functions, enables us to continue to complement the
manufacturing excellence programs that are being developed.
Risk Management: Strategic, operating and financial business risks are reviewed by the Risk Management Committee
on a regular basis. In addition to the above risks, the committee monitors any potential new risks that may arise due
to changes in the external environment. While the possibility of a negative impact due to one or more of such risks
cannot be totally avoided, the Company proactively takes reasonable steps to pre-empt and mitigate these.
8.
INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS AND THEIR ADEQUACY
